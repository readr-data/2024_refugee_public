But who are these and other Conservative factions? And why do they exert so much influence?One Nation caucus One Nation Conservatives chair Damian GreenWho are they? The largest single group within the parliamentary party says more than 100 Conservative MPs are members, almost a third of the total. The phrase, ""one-nation Tory"", goes back to 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, but the caucus was formed only in 2019. Who is in the group and what do they want?Chaired by former First Secretary of State Damian Green, it says it is ""committed to the values of the liberal centre right"". Many of its members represent traditionally Tory ""blue wall"" seats where the Liberal Democrats are the main challengers.  Some were known to be unhappy that Mr Sunak's new Rwanda bill sets aside some of the UK's obligations in international law, but they backed the bill while warning the PM not to toughen it further.   Former Solicitor General Lord Garnier, who advised the caucus, had described the bill as political and legal ""nonsense"", equivalent to ruling ""all dogs are cats"". Other leading lights include Education Secretary Gillian Keegan, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and Caroline Nokes, who chairs the women and equalities committee.European Research Group Getty ImagesVeteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill CashWho are they? Once the most powerful grouping of Tory MPs, the ERG played a key role in blocking Theresa May's Brexit deal and then bringing her down as prime minister, which paved the way for successor Boris Johnson to strike a harder Brexit. It does not publish information about its membership, but this is currently thought to be in the 30s, significantly down on its Brexit heyday.  Who is in the group and what do they want?However, the ERG has often punched above its weight, and numerous leading lights have gone on to bigger things - including Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Suella Braverman. New illegal migration minister Michael Tomlinson was deputy chair of the group from 2016-2018.  It has been pressing for a hardline approach on the illegal migration issue and its so-called ""star chamber"" - a group of lawyers chaired by veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash - concluded the Rwanda legislation did not go far enough. The ERG - chaired by Mark Francois - said ""very significant amendments"" were needed. It is likely to push strongly for these in the new year.New ConservativesGetty ImagesNew Conservatives co-chair Miriam CatesWho are they? Formed only in May 2023, the New Conservatives have fast become one of the most vocal factions within the party. Who is in the group and what do they want?Around 30 MPs are members, including deputy Tory chairman Lee Anderson, and group co-chairs Miriam Cates and Danny Kruger.  Most were elected in 2019, many in marginal, traditionally Labour, ""red wall"" seats in the north of England and the Midlands. The New Conservatives have called for radical measures to cut migration and pressed the government to deliver deportations to Rwanda by ""unpicking"" many of the UK's international obligations. Ms Cates and Mr Kruger were among the 29 Tories who refused to back the Rwanda bill in the Commons. On broader policy, the group says the party needs to return its 2019 manifesto by delivering levelling up and reducing taxes, rein back on green measures, and ban ""gender ideology"" in schools.  Common Sense Group ReutersSir John Hayes is a close ally of Suella BravermanWho are they?Launched in 2020 and with around 30 members, the CSG is led by former Home Office minister Sir John Hayes, a close ally of Suella Braverman. Who is in the group and what do they want?Like Mrs Braverman, Sir John has been fiercely critical of Mr Sunak's Rwanda approach and, alongside the New Conservatives, the group has been pressing for tougher action on both illegal and legal migration.It has also pushed hard on culture issues, such as Mr Sunak's plans to phase out smoking, other manifestations of what it regards as ""the nanny state"", and what it described as the National Trust's ""woke agenda"" on colonialism. Other leading figures include Lee Anderson, Brendan Clarke-Smith and Jonathan Gullis. Sir John and Mrs Braverman both abstained on the government's bill. Northern Research Group  Who are they?Thought to number more than 50 MPs, the group was formed in 2019 to press for greater investment in ""red wall"" areas in the north of England, Wales and the Scottish borders.   Who is in the group and what do they want?Senior figures include former party chairman and Northern Powerhouse minister Sir Jake Berry, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, and Esther McVey, who returned to the cabinet last month. The NRG regards immigration as an important issue for many of its MPs' voters. Sir Jake was one of those who withheld his support for the Rwanda bill. PA MediaFormer prime minister Liz Truss addressed a packed fringed event at the Conservative Party conference in OctoberConservative Growth GroupWho are they?Around 50 MPs are thought to be members of a group set up in the aftermath of Liz Truss's disastrous, short tenure at No 10. Who is in the group and what do they want?Its focus is chiefly economic: it advocates the libertarian policies it believes Ms Truss was prevented from introducing by the unravelling of her mini-budget in September-October 2022. It says the policies needed to break out of a long period of low growth include slashing business taxes and stamp duty, toughening benefit requirements, relaxing planning, and reintroducing fracking. Prominent figures include former Home Secretary Dame Priti Patel and former Levelling-Up Secretary Sir Simon Clarke. She backed the bill in the Commons; he abstained.  Other groupsThese include No Turning Back - formed as far back as 1985 - to promote Margaret Thatcher's policies. Since 2005, it has been chaired by Sir John Redwood, who has campaigned for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights to ensure the Rwanda plan can go ahead without further legal delays. He abstained on the bill. The Conservative Democratic Organisation, launched a year ago, was widely thought to be a front for an effort to restore Boris Johnson to Downing Street. It has denied this. It calls for greater party democracy and condemned Mr Sunak's ""coronation"" as prime minister without a Tory members' vote. It has also described his sacking of Ms Braverman as ""political suicide"". Dame Priti Patel, Nadine Dorries, who is no longer an MP, and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg are prominent. supporters.

"3 July 2023","Tory MPs issue plan for Rishi Sunak to slash migration","Tory MPs issue plan for Rishi Sunak to slash migration3 July 2023ShareJoshua NevettBBC PoliticsShareGetty ImagesRishi Sunak has been under pressure to reduce migration to the UKA group of Tory MPs is calling on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so ""risks eroding public trust"".The New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election.The group of MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers.But critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy.Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government believes it is ""striking the right balance between keeping migration as low as possible while providing staff for key areas"".The UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.The ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong.The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010.The party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000.Sunak says migration 'too high' as new record setWho is allowed to come to live in the UK?Moving target Tories keep trying to hitIn a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives say the British public ""did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings"".""Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,"" the report says.The report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of like-minded Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, Miriam Cates and James Daly.At the report's launch, Mr Hunt, Ms Cates and Mr Daly insisted they were loyal to the prime minister, but felt his government could go further on cutting immigration.One of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers.The report says this policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000, leading to a reduction in long-term inward migration to the UK of 82,000.Part of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn £38,000 a year or more.A report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22.Sam Monaghan, chief executive at Methodist Homes, said not being able to recruit carers from overseas would put more pressure on the sector.""Cutting off a key supply of care workers at a time when 500,000 people nationwide are waiting for care is not the answer,"" Mr Monaghan said.Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government was not planning to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list.The government was ""using the flexibility we have through our migration system to ensure we have sufficient staff in key areas"" and ""looking to boost the numbers of domestic care staff that are available"", Downing Street said.Ms Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector.She said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force ""employers to look at recruiting local young people"". ""We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,"" the Tory MP said.But fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said while the principle of reducing met migration was right, there was a shortage of care workers in the UK.""It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,"" he said. ""There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country.""Some of the report's other proposals include: Tightening restrictions on student visas to stop graduates staying in the UK for longer than two years without a job offerCapping the number of refugees legally accepted for resettlement in the UK at 20,000A 5% cap on the amount of social housing that councils can give to non-UK nationalsRaising the health surcharge that an individual immigrant would pay to use the NHS to £2,700 per person, per yearMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said ""trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard"".""Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,"" she said.She said immigration policy was a ""political choice"" and there was ""no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive"".But she said the report does not ""engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve"".""For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,"" Ms Sumption said. ""International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education.""She said some of the proposals in the report were ""a bit outlandish"".""Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,"" she added. ""However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them.""Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migrationHow many people come to live in the UK?Legal migration is too high, says Rishi SunakConservative PartyUK immigrationImmigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66084962"

As first reported by The Times, they raised concerns after the home secretary said being gay or a woman should not entitle people to protection as a refugee. She later said some people ""purport"" to be gay, to try to ""game the system"".A source close to Ms Braverman said: ""The home secretary speaks for the concerns of the majority of the British people about uncontrolled, illegal migration - and as someone who works on this issue day in, day out and was a lawyer on well over 100 immigration and asylum cases.""PM won't say if Braverman right on multiculturalismDiscrimination not enough for asylum - BravermanBraverman grooming claim misleading - regulatorThe MPs have spoken to the BBC on condition of anonymity. ""Why do you need to single out one section of people?"" asked one. A source close to the Home Secretary insisted that gay people were not singled out. It is not the first time, MPs say, that there have been concerns about the home secretary's tone.It is unclear exactly what will happen as a result of the complaints but it is expected government Chief Whip Simon Hart - who is in charge of party discipline - will relay the concerns to the prime minister.Sources have also suggested Ms Braverman may speak personally to some of those who are unhappy.Downing Street has said it signed off the home secretary's speech to a Washington DC think tank on Tuesday.Earlier this week, one Conservative MP told the BBC: ""The danger is that unless the PM deals with her [sacks her], it reflects poorly on him.""Home Office figures show 1,334 asylum applications were lodged in the UK in 2022, where sexual orientation formed part of the basis for the claim.This represented 1.5% of the 74,751 asylum claims made last year.'Unhelpful noises' Meanwhile, former defence minister Tobias Ellwood has told the BBC Ms Braverman does not represent the Conservative Party with her comments on multiculturalism.In a BBC interview on Thursday, Rishi Sunak repeatedly declined to say if he agreed with his home secretary that multiculturalism had ""failed"" in the UK.In her speech in Washington, Ms Braverman argued that multiculturalism was a ""misguided dogma"" which had allowed people to ""live parallel lives"".Asked if she was wrong, the prime minister said the UK had ""done an incredible job of integrating people into society"".In an interview with Politics South, to be broadcast on Sunday, Mr Ellwood said that, in the lead-up to the Tory conference which opens in Manchester on Sunday, Ms Braverman was ""making noises in a particular direction for a particular audience, which I think are unhelpful"".  ""We've had a turbulent couple of years, let's be honest about it, and we're starting to calm things down. Statecraft is returning to No 10. ""And I just wish we'd recognise there is an election approaching. We're starting to do better in the polls...  Let's focus on supporting this prime minister.""Our party does well when we approach from the centre right, that's where we do well. When we go to the extremes, in the same way when the Labour Party goes to the extremes, you never win.""In a separate development, the Independent Press Standards Organisation has ruled that a claim by the home secretary that UK child grooming gangs were ""almost all British-Pakistani men"" was misleading, The press regulator instructed the Mail on Sunday to publish an online correction to an opinion piece written by Ms Braverman in April. The correction now links the claim to high-profile cases like the Rotherham abuse scandal.   A source close to Ms Braverman described the IPSO ruling as ""perverse"".

But MPs from a different section of the party described this as a ""red-line"".Rwanda treaty deals with legal concerns - CleverlySupreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The prime minister promised a bill to deal with concerns raised last month by the Supreme Court over the government's scheme to send asylum seekers to east Africa.Mr Sunak is due to announce emergency legislation in ""days not weeks"", Home Office minister Chris Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The bill is designed to work in conjunction with the new treaty, which will see the UK pay for Rwandan authorities to process asylum applications for people who come to the UK.The new agreement will mean that the UK will also pay for British and Commonwealth judges to preside over a newly established appeals process as well as the costs of all legal fees from anyone sent to Rwanda.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said the Rwanda scheme was designed to act as a deterrent to people coming to the UK in small boat crossings and to ""break the cycle of tragedy"" of people smuggling.In January, Mr Sunak made ""stop the boats"" one of his top five priorities. He said he would ""do everything it takes to get this scheme working so that we can indeed stop the boats"".Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the next election.At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer labelled the plan a ""gimmick"" that cost the UK ""hundreds of millions of pounds for nothing in return"".1:33Sir Keir Starmer asks Rishi Sunak: How many people sent to Rwanda?The BBC understands centrist Tory MPs are worried Mr Sunak may be considering Mrs Braverman's plans to disregard human rights law as part of the Rwanda plan.Mrs Braverman, the former home secretary, has previously argued that the bill should ignore ""the entirety"" of the Human Rights Act (HRA) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), as well as other relevant international obligations including the Refugee Convention.Another option is for the bill to declare Rwanda a safe country. The BBC understands Mr Sunak is hoping to steer a middle course between those options.Mrs Braverman has made a personal statement to MPs on Wednesday afternoon, saying the bill must block all routes of legal challenge, to allow flights to Rwanda to take off. Conservative splitsThe One Nation Caucus, which has a current membership of 106 Conservative MPs, called on the prime minister to ""think twice before overriding"" either the ECHR and HRA.Former deputy prime minister Damian Green, who now chairs the One Nation Caucus, said: ""Successive Conservative governments have played a vital role in creating and protecting the ECHR as well as the Refugee and Torture conventions. ""We have continued to hold these treaties dear and they should be seen as fundamental to part of protecting the UK's democratic legacy."" Matt Warman, a leading member of the group, said: ""Overriding the ECHR is a red line for a number of Conservatives. Protecting and reforming institutions and upholding human rights should be the cornerstone of any Conservative government.""Mark Francois, the chair of the right-wing European Research Group (ERG), said the group would not back any new legislation that does not ""fully respect the sovereignty of Parliament, with unambiguous wording"".The ERG, an influential group among Brexit-supporting MPs, said they would only support the bill if it won the approval of the group's ""star chamber"" of legal experts chaired by the veteran MP Bill Cash.Former minister Tory MP Sir Simon Clarke said there was raw anger among his constituents about migration.He said: ""It cannot be the case that a human rights framework which was set up in the late 1940s, which could never have envisaged a world in which tens of thousands of people were coming to this country illegally and we were unable to deport them, is regarded as so sacrosanct that we can't change it.""What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulTougher visa rules unveiled in plan to cut migrationJames CleverlyRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67634887"

""So what everyone should do is support this bill.""Confidence matterWith some Tory MPs in open revolt over the direction of the policy, Mr Sunak is facing questions over whether he can win a vote to support the passage of the bill in Parliament.A government can designate a key vote as a confidence matter. This is a means of putting pressure on MPs to vote with the government on a specific issue.It is a high-risk tactic, as the loss of such a confidence vote can trigger a general election. But Mr Sunak indicated he would not play this card.At the news conference, Mr Sunak was asked if he was telling Tory MPs to ""back me or sack me"", a phrase used by former Tory Prime Minister John Major when he faced a leadership challenge in 1995.Mr Sunak did not answer the question directly but said his ""patience with this has worn thin"".""We've got to end the legal merry-go-round that has blocked us from getting our Rwanda scheme up and running,"" he said.Mr Sunak said ""the real question is for the Labour Party"", which has pledged to scrap the Rwanda policy if it wins the next election, casting doubt over its long-term future.The prime minister said: ""The question is for everyone else, and crucially the Labour Party, what's their plan? They are going to vote for this legislation?""The goading of Labour, and the impromptu news conference, suggests the prime minister has realised the political danger that lies ahead for his government.There are some suggestions Conservative MPs might try to trigger a party confidence vote in Mr Sunak's leadership.Some other Conservatives believe the party's unruliness might compel Mr Sunak to call a general election earlier than expected.The prime minister's press conference does not seem to have done much to calm tensions in his party.A group of Tory right-wingers are taking legal advice on the bill before deciding whether to back it, or move against it next week.The One Nation group of Tory MPs, seen as moderate, have also employed a lawyer to examine the legislation.The task of steering the bill through Parliament falls to Michael Tomlinson, who was appointed illegal migration minister on Thursday.He will work alongside Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, after the prime minister split Mr Jenrick's vacant role in two.Braverman: Tories face oblivion if Rwanda bill failsRobert Jenrick resigns over Rwanda migrant billCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Conservative PartyRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67649447"

""He doesn't want to stop the boats, he wants to welcome more of them,"" Mr Sunak said.Tory uproarWhen he first took office last year, Mr Sunak said ""stopping the boats"" would be one of five key priorities for his government ahead of the next general election.More than 45,700 people crossed the Channel to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.As of this month, the number of small boat crossings in 2023 was a third lower than at the same point the year before.The Supreme Court's ruling represents a serious setback for Mr Sunak's asylum policy, and has infuriated Tory MPs who have been critical of his leadership.The ruling came the day after the sacked Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, released an incendiary letter accusing the prime minister of breaking promises over immigration.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mrs Braverman said the government ""must introduce emergency legislation"".She said ""there is no chance of curbing illegal migration within the current legal framework"", adding ""we must legislate or admit defeat"".And Mr Sunak is facing calls from Mrs Braverman's allies on the Tory right to withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty.But the Supreme Court made it clear in its judgment that domestic law, as well as international treaties, were relevant to the court's decision.1:36Watch: Starmer quizzes PM on 'magical thinking' on small boatsConservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the government should ""ignore the laws"" and send migrants back the same day they arrive in the UK.Former Levelling Up Secretary, Sir Simon Clarke, has called for emergency legislation within ""days certainly not more than weeks"" to push forward with the Rwanda scheme.And Sir John Hayes, a close ally of Mrs Braverman, told the BBC that the former home secretary spoke for the ""vast majority of law-abiding Britons"" in saying ""it's just not right"" that the UK cannot get rid of people who enter the country illegally.Conservative MP for Dover Natalie Elphicke said new Foreign Secretary David Cameron should get ""a fast ferry to France"", take advantage of his ""long-standing relationship"" with President Emmanuel Macron and negotiate a new deal to stop boats leaving the French coast.

There were also rebellions from Conservative MPs connected to the limits and conditions of detaining unaccompanied children.One of the rebels, former Conservative minister Tim Loughton, said the ""assurances that we were promised have not materialised or, if they have, I am afraid nobody understands them"".He complained about the timing of the concessions and said ""more work needs to be done"" on scrutinising the bill before it becomes law.1:42Robert Jenrick says cartoons in an asylum reception centre were painted over as they were not ""age appropriate"" for teenagers.One of the most controversial aspects of the bill would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove migrants arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another ""safe"" third country.Stephen Kinnock, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said the government's Rwanda plan was ""fundamentally flawed"", and he accused Mr Jenrick of ""pettiness"" for painting over Mickey Mouse cartoons in an immigration centre.Mr Kinnock said the bill would ""only make a terrible situation worse"" by increasing the asylum backlog, and ""ensure people smugglers are laughing all the way to the bank"".Race to recessWith Parliament due to break for summer at the end of next week, the bill faces a prolonged stand-off between peers and the government during so-called parliamentary ping-pong, when legislation is batted between the Lords and Commons until agreement on the wording can be reached.The latest figures show more than 13,000 migrants have made the crossing so far this year, including more than 1,600 in the last four days.The government's efforts to curb the number of small boats crossing the Channel have been hampered in Parliament and the courts.A plan to house asylum seekers on a barge moored in Dorset has been delayed.And the government's policy of sending migrants to Rwanda is set for a legal battle in the Supreme Court.On Monday, a senior Home Office official confirmed the department was paying to keep nearly 5,000 beds empty across the country, in case a sudden influx of migrants caused overcrowding at detention centres. The government has stressed it remains committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, and has said it will challenge a Court of Appeal ruling last week that this was unlawful.Lords back Archbishop's plan for refugee strategyLords vote to keep child migrant detention limitsGovernment defeated in Lords over small boats billImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66168280"

Mr Jenrick also proposed an amendment which would ensure ministers automatically reject last-minute interim orders from the European Court of Human Rights.Such an order was responsible for blocking a flight to Rwanda back in June 2022.The amendment was not approved by MPs but received the backing of 61 Conservatives - the biggest rebellion of Mr Sunak's premiership.Some MPs had suggested they would be willing to abstain or even vote against the entire bill if it remained unchanged.The bill could have fallen if about 30 Conservatives had voted against it - an outcome that would have severely damaged the prime minister's authority, potentially fatally.However, in the event, just 11 MPs - including Mr Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - voted against it.Other Tory MPs on the list include Miriam Cates, Sir Simon Clarke, Mark Francois and Danny Kruger.Eighteen Conservative MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining.Conservative Danny Kruger, who voted against the bill, said some of his colleagues had opted to support the legislation despite their concerns in order to avoid ""political disruption"".Sir Simon Clarke, who also opposed the bill said: ""All Conservatives want the Rwanda policy to succeed... the profound misgivings some of us hold about the bill are on record, but history will now relate who was right.""Labour opposed the bill, with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper labelling the policy a ""costly con"" that had so far failed to send any asylum seekers to Rwanda.Home Secretary James Cleverly defended the plan arguing that it sent ""an unambiguously clear message that if you enter the United Kingdom illegally you cannot stay"". ""This bill has been meticulously drafted to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges,"" he added. The debate over the legislation has exposed on-going divisions among Conservatives - on Tuesday evening two deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quit their roles in order to vote for the rebel amendments.Despite his concerns, Mr Clarke-Smith back the bill at the final stage, while Mr Anderson did not register a vote. One rebel source told the BBC: ""It is not the case that tonight's vote is the end of matters. ""If the House of Lords chooses - as I suspect they will - to send back amendments that weaken the bill, the response of those [right-wing Conservative MPs] will be to table amendments in lieu that toughen the bill.""HoCThe Rwanda bill passed the through the House of Commons by 320 votes for to 276 votes againstThe bill is now expected to face further opposition in the House of Lords, where many peers are concerned about whether it complies with international law. Crossbench peer Lord Carlile, a leading lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that while peers would not ""thwart the government"", the Lords had a responsibility to ""protect the public from abuses of legal correctness and principle by the government"". ""We've seen in various other countries the damage that can be done when governments use perceived and often ill-judged political imperatives to place themselves above the courts,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a step towards totalitarianism and an attitude that the United Kingdom usually deprecates.""As his press conference, Mr Sunak is likely to urge peers to pass the bill quickly to finally allow the policy to get off the ground. But even once the bill becomes law, Tory rebels say it will not work as they believe planes will be grounded once again by legal challenges.Home Office minister Chris Philp told BBC Breakfast the government was aiming for flights to take off this spring. He played down divisions in the party and insisted ""there was near unanimity on the Conservative side that this bill as a whole made sense and represents a very significant step forward"". On Wednesday Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said he would return money to the UK  if no asylum seekers were sent to his country.The UK has so far paid £240m to the east African nation and is expected to pay a further £50m.A Rwandan government spokeswoman later said the country had ""no obligation"" to return the money but would consider a request for a refund from the UK. In Westminster, a Downing Street spokesman was forced to deny it was trying to change the Civil Service code to include a presumption that emergency injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights should be ignored.At the start of the day Home Office Minister Michael Tomlinson had said the government was ""looking at that"", but hours later No 10 said it was not seeking to rewrite the code. The Cabinet Office later issued guidance stating that it was the ""responsibility"" of civil servants to ""implement"" a minister's decision to ignore rulings from the court.

Writing in the Telegraph, the pair said the draft law did not block off the right to individual appeals over removals and was highly unlikely to ensure significant numbers of migrants were sent to Rwanda before the next election. They called on the government to come forward with amendments to address its limitations. Meanwhile, Tory MPs from the more liberal end of the party say they will support it in its current form, but have warned against any changes further down the line, arguing they could breach international law.It means Mr Sunak is facing the biggest challenge to his authority from his MPs, who could inflict humiliation on the PM over one of his key policies.MPs are currently debating the bill in the Commons, with a vote due from 19:00 GMT onwards.How much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Chris Mason analysis: PM's authority is on the lineThe government's legislation has been drawn up to revive the Rwanda scheme, after the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful last month over fears it could lead to human rights breaches.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send asylum seekers to, and stop flights being grounded for legal reasons.The aim of the policy is to deter migrants crossing the Channel in small boats - something Mr Sunak has made a key priority of his government.However, some Tory MPs are concerned it does not go far enough to prevent further legal challenges derailing deportations. With Labour and other opposition parties opposing the bill, and with several Tory MPs indicating they could abstain, the parliamentary maths is looking tight for the government.A bill has not been defeated at second reading since 1986.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he will scrap the Rwanda plan if his party wins the next election, arguing the £290m due to be given to the east African country as part of the scheme would be better spent tackling people-smuggling gangs.0:39Keir Starmer: ''The charade continues'' on RwandaAhead of the vote, several senior Tories, including former defence secretary Ben Wallace and attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, have called on MPs to unite, warning disunity would spell disaster for the party ahead of the next election.The New Conservatives group, whom Mr Sunak met for around an hour on Tuesday morning, has said the bill requires ""major surgery or replacement"".According to MPs present at the meeting, the prime minister told potential rebels he was willing to discuss ""tightening up"" the draft law.Some MPs told Mr Sunak they would abstain or vote against the bill later. However, it is understood others are planning to vote for the bill, in the hope it gets amended further down the line.The European Research Group (ERG) - another group on the party's right - has argued ""very significant amendments"" are needed to prevent legal challenges to Rwanda deportations.The group have not yet revealed how they plan to vote and have been meeting to decide their next steps.Robert Jenrick - who quit as immigration minister over the legislation last week - said it was ""not a bad bill,"" but needed strengthening to prevent individual claims against deportation.Speaking in the Commons, he said deportees would ""stop at nothing"" to avoid being sent to Rwanda, telling MPs: ""give them an inch, and they'll take a mile"".1:43Watch: Mark Francois and David Jones of the European Research Group calls on the government to scrap the billHowever, agreeing to the demands of MPs on the right of the party would risk losing the support of more centrist Tories. The One Nation group, which includes more than 100 Tory MPs, said it was recommending its members vote for the bill at this stage, but warned it would oppose any future amendments ""that would mean the UK government breaching the rule of law and its international obligations"".A defeat of such a key piece of legislation would potentially presage a leadership election for Mr Sunak, perhaps even a general election.Downing Street said the government was listening to the views of MPs but insisted it would not pull the vote.Those who want the Rwanda bill to go further argue it could still leave the scheme open to legal challenge by individuals, who could argue deportation to Rwanda would put them at risk of serious harm.In an attempt to win over critics, the government took the unusual step of publishing a summary of its own legal advice on the scheme. The advice argues that the grounds for individual challenges to deportation will be ""exceptionally narrow"" under the bill, and a blanket ban on appeals would breach international law.It gives examples such as people in the late stages of pregnancy who are unfit to fly or with very rare medical conditions that could not be cared for in Rwanda.However, critics argue that even if only some of these claims succeed, they would still clog up the courts and delay removals.Rwanda law doesn't go far enough, Tory group saysHow much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?UK immigrationImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67684785"

Last month the UK's Supreme Court ruled plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were unlawful. The government has promised emergency legislation, designed to address the court's concerns.On Tuesday, Home Secretary James Cleverly also signed a new treaty with Rwanda. The government hopes the treaty, combined with the new bill, will be enough to allow the Rwanda scheme to go ahead. The policy, which was first announced by then Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022, aims to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats. But it has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK yet. Tory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In a personal statement to the House of Commons after she was sacked from her cabinet role last month, Mrs Braverman said she welcomed the decision to introduce emergency legislation but said ""we are running out of time"". ""The Conservative Party faces electoral oblivion in a matter of months if we introduce yet another bill destined to fail,"" she told MPs. ""Do we fight for sovereignty or do we let our party die?""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made stopping small boat crossings one of his top priorities ahead of the next general election, which must take place by January 2025.Mrs Braverman said the bill must deliver on the prime minister's pledge to stop small boat crossings and set out a number of tests she said it must meet to do this. These included addressing the Supreme Court's concerns about the safety of Rwanda and ""blocking off all routes of challenge"" to enable flights carrying asylum seekers to the east African country before the next election. Although Mrs Braverman said she supported leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), she said this was not the only way to stop the boats. ""I accept that the government won't do that and that it is a debate for another day,"" she added. Instead she proposed that the bill should override the UK's Human Rights Act, the ECHR and other international law. ""The powers to detain and remove must be exercisable notwithstanding the Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention, and all other international law,"" she said. She added that Parliament should be prepared to sit over Christmas to pass the bill.Tory splitsMrs Braverman was flanked by supporters as she gave her statement but there are splits within the Conservative Party over her proposals. One senior Tory MP told the BBC her statement ""was just the latest performance in the leadership pantomime"". Rather than disregarding human rights law, another option is for the bill to simply declare Rwanda a safe country. The BBC understands Mr Sunak is hoping to steer a middle course between those options.The One Nation Caucus, which has a current membership of 106 Tory MPs, called on the prime minister to ""think twice before overriding"" either the ECHR and HRA.The group's chairman, former Deputy Prime Minister Damian Green said: ""Successive Conservative governments have played a vital role in creating and protecting the ECHR as well as the Refugee and Torture conventions.""Another leading member of the group, Matt Warman, said overriding the ECHR was ""a red line for a number of Conservatives"". However, Mark Francois, chairman of the right-wing European Research Group (ERG), said it would not back any new legislation that does not ""fully respect the sovereignty of Parliament, with unambiguous wording"".Former Minister Sir Simon Clarke said there was ""raw anger"" among his constituents about migration.He told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""It cannot be the case that a human rights framework which was set up in the late 1940s, which could never have envisaged a world in which tens of thousands of people were coming to this country illegally and we were unable to deport them, is regarded as so sacrosanct that we can't change it.""The UK's highest court ruled the Rwanda policy was unlawful because there were ""substantial grounds"" to believe that some of those deported to the country could be sent back to places where they would be unsafe.The government says its new treaty will address these concerns by ensuring no one is removed by Rwanda to any other country except the UK.Experts from the UK will also be sent to Rwanda to assist with the processing of asylum decisions.ReutersHome Secretary James Cleverly signed a new treaty with Rwanda on TuesdaySince leaving government, Mrs Braverman has been a vocal critic of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. In a scathing letter following her sacking she accused the PM of ""betraying"" his promise to do whatever it takes to ""stop the boats"". However, in her Commons statement she struck a more conciliatory tone, saying Mr Sunak ""should be commended for dedicating more time and toil than any of his predecessors"" to the issue. She added that tougher visa rules announced earlier this week ""start to better reflect public frustration on legal migration"". ""If we summon the political courage to do what is truly necessary, difficult though it may be, to fight for the British people, we will regain their trust,"" she said.""And if the prime minister leads that fight, he has my total support.""Tory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawRwanda treaty deals with legal concerns - CleverlySupreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationSuella BravermanImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67639843"

The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds.Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights.'Win the argument'The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended.A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful.However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"".He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum.He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly.Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably.One Nation pressureMinisters could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament.And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law.The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda.""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Rwanda bill overrides some human rights lawLabour aims to force Rwanda documents publicationSunak’s Rwanda law at mercy of Tory factionsRobert JenrickRishi SunakRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783"

Tory MPs from different factions are divided and are considering whether to vote for the bill at its first stage.A rebellion by Tory MPs could sink this central policy of Mr Sunak's and seriously weaken his authority.The ERG commissioned a so-called star chamber of lawyers to analyse the Safety of Rwanda Bill and held a meeting to present their findings ahead of Tuesday's vote.In a setback for Mr Sunak, the group said the bill ""provides a partial and incomplete solution to the problem of legal challenges in the UK courts being used as stratagems to delay or defeat the removal of illegal migrants to Rwanda"".The group said resolving the issues raised by their lawyers ""would require very significant amendments"".ERG chairman Mark Francois said: ""The feeling very much in the meeting is that the government would be best advised to pull the bill and come up with a revised version that works better than this one which has so many holes in it."" The meeting also included other groups on the right of the Tory Party.

LIVE: Tory MPs say Rwanda plan doesn't go far enoughHow much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Rwanda bill is too weak to be a deterrent, says Robert JenrickWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The ERG's legal analysis argues the bill still allows individuals to challenge their removal to Rwanda if their specific personal circumstances mean this would put them at risk of serious harm. It says this represents ""a significant risk to delivery of the scheme"". In an attempt to win over critics, the government has published a summary of its legal position on the scheme. The document says the bill allows for ""an exceptionally narrow route to individual challenge"".It gives examples such as people in the late stages of pregnancy who are unfit to fly or with very rare medical conditions that could not be cared for in Rwanda. The document adds: ""In any case, completely blocking any court challenges would be a breach of international law and alien to the UK's constitutional tradition of liberty and justice.""It concludes that ""the government's approach is tough but fair and lawful"" and ""seeks to uphold our international obligations"". The Rwanda bill has split Conservative MPs, with some more moderate Tories arguing the bill risks breaching the UK's international legal obligations towards refugees.The centrist One Nation Conservatives will hold a separate evening meeting in Parliament before releasing a statement on their judgment.PA MediaThe Rwanda policy aims to deter people crossing the Channel in small boatsEarlier, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps urged MPs to support the bill and denied Mr Sunak's leadership was in ""chaos"" over the Rwanda policy.The defence secretary said he had ""no doubt at all"" the legislation would pass in the House of Commons.It is very rare for a bill to be defeated at its first Commons hurdle as there are opportunities for MPs to propose changes at later stages. However, Labour and opposition parties have already said they will try and vote it down, meaning the government needs to ensure enough Tory MPs vote for it to allow it to pass.Tory critics of the bill could decide to allow it to pass at this stage, possibly by abstaining, in the hope of securing concessions from the government as it goes through the Commons.Last week, the government introduced the legislation which would see people seeking UK asylum sent to Rwanda, after the policy was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last month.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country, with a view to stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds.The Rwanda policy is part of the government's plan to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats.Mr Sunak has said ""stopping the boats"" is one of five main priorities, after a record 45,774 people made the journey last year.Charm offensiveAhead of the vote, the government has been circulating modelling showing the projected effects of the Rwanda bill.According to Home Office modelling conducted earlier this year, 90% of those appealing against deportation to Rwanda would see their appeals rejected by the government between 10 and 12 days after arriving in the UK because they would fail to provide evidence they face serious harm if deported to the African country. Of the 10% given permission to appeal to an immigration tribunal, only 5% would be expected to have their appeals accepted, with the rest sent to Rwanda, the model claims.The projections are part of a document prepared in March during discussions about the illegal migration bill when Suella Braverman was home secretary and Robert Jenrick was immigration minister.Both Mrs Braverman and Mr Jenrick now argue the emergency legislation does not go far enough, with Mr Jenrick resigning from his government role last week over the issue.The modelling, which has been seen by the BBC, was first reported by The Times.The government will use the document to try to win over Conservative MPs concerned that there would be too many successful appeals.But Mr Sunak's critics argue that the Supreme Court's ruling last month that Rwanda is an unsafe country for asylum seekers means the context has changed since the modelling was conducted, and more appeals would be successful.One sceptical senior Tory source said the model was ""outdated and analytically flawed"".""There was never any modelling done for the new Rwanda bill because they failed to plan,"" the source said. ""Even this old, optimistic model says it could take more than two months to remove a migrant. It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.""Last week, the Home Office's top civil servant Sir Matthew Rycroft revealed the UK had given Rwanda a further £100m this year to deliver the scheme.The figure was on top of the £140m already paid to the country and a further £50m expected next year. Appearing in front of the Commons Public Accounts Committee earlier on Monday, Sir Matthew said the figure had been published after the government discovered it had been ""inadvertently"" disclosed to the International Monetary Fund by someone in Rwanda. However, he refused to say how much more money the UK had already agreed to pay Rwanda for subsequent years of the initial five-year deal.PM faces Covid inquiry and Rwanda vote in key weekSunak's 'weak' Rwanda plan won't work - JenrickUK earmarks £700m for small boat arrivals to 2030Refugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67680136"

There are refugees. There is illegal immigration. Overlapping descriptions and labels, many of which provoke fury and anger. And so to that word - amnesty. Both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir are seeking to weaponize it, to make what they see as a negative point about their opponent. The Labour leader accused Mr Sunak of a ""Travelodge amnesty"" - people who have arrived in small boats and are, in UK law, illegal immigrants. They are stuck in limbo in UK hotels at significant expense to the taxpayer. Incidentally, Sir Keir did this while projecting a confidence I've not seen before in him. Not just his manner on stage, but his willingness to praise a Conservative idea - the Small Boats Operational Command - strictly up to a point, which he claims he would build on. And praise a Conservative cabinet minister, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.It amounted, in the round, I thought, to a man with the air of an heir.A man - after those local election results and the second defection to his party from the Conservatives in a fortnight - who might just feel closer to the prospect of becoming prime minister than ever before. Seven takeaways from the local electionsConservative MP Dan Poulter defects to LabourTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourSir Keir's label of a claimed Conservative ""Travelodge amnesty"" is an attempt to push back at the Tory description of Labour's plan to allow people who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum.Yes, you guessed it, the Conservatives describe that as an amnesty too. Both leaders clearly see a political value in projecting an aggression on this topic and portraying their opponent as weak, even soft.The big picture here, acknowledged by them both and illustrated in this example, is this is deeply complex and there is no off the shelf panacea on offer. What do you do about the huge backlogs of people? How do you create deterrents to crossing the Channel? Are deterrents even possible? What does fairness and justice look like, to people contemplating a crossing, others seeking a legal route to the UK, and the British taxpayer? Are international legal frameworks, domestic laws, or agreements with other countries up to scale of the challenge?Returning more people not granted asylum to their country of origin is key.BBC Verify has been looking at how this might apply to recent small boat arrivals.Vietnamese people - 1,266 in total - and Afghans - 1,216 people - make up the top two nationalities arriving in the UK this way so far this year.The next most common nationalities to have arrived this way between 1 January and 21 April 2024 were Iranians, Syrians and Eritreans.Of these five countries, the government only has a returns agreement with Vietnam, so ministers in this government or any future one would have to negotiate agreements with the other four if the asylum seekers' claims were rejected.Plus none of them currently feature on the government's list of where people can be safely returned, which poses a further potential challenge.It is for Mr Sunak, Sir Keir and others to win arguments and gain trust on this most difficult, emotional, diplomatic and political of issues - and to grapple for solutions. As partial, long winded and expensive as they may prove to be.Starmer vows to scrap Rwanda scheme 'straight away'What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Conservative PartyKeir StarmerRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakLabour PartyMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68994326"
"9 August 2023","Tories could campaign to leave European human rights treaty if Rwanda flights blocked","Tories could campaign to leave European human rights treaty if Rwanda flights blocked9 August 2023ShareNick EardleyBBC chief political correspondentShareGetty ImagesThe Rwanda plan aims to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boatsSenior Conservatives - including a cabinet minister - say their party is likely to campaign to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) at the next election, if Rwanda flights continue to be blocked.There is frustration at the role of a European court in stopping flights for asylum seekers taking off last year.The minister told the BBC the UK was ""probably"" being punished for Brexit.The government's official position is that the UK will remain in the ECHR.A spokesperson said: ""The government has been clear that it will abide by its international treaty obligations.""As we've set out previously - we believe our Stop the Boats Bill will deliver the changes necessary to reduce the incentives for people to risk their lives through illegal crossings while remaining party to the ECHR."" However, immigration minister Robert Jenrick would not rule out withdrawing from the convention, telling Times Radio the government would do ""whatever is necessary ultimately to defend our borders"". The comments by senior figures in government are likely to reignite a debate in the Conservative Party about the ECHR - which splits opinion among Tory MPs.  European court at odds with UK values - BravermanWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Sir Bob Neill, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Justice Committee, said it would be ""a completely foolish idea and absolutely wrong"" for the UK to leave the ECHR. He told the BBC that being outside the ECHR would leave the UK in the company of Belarus and Russia, and there would be a danger Britain's international reputation would be ""very seriously damaged"". The ECHR was established in 1950 by a number of countries including the UK. The treaty, which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries, is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights.It is separate to the European Union - so the UK remained part of both after Brexit. Ministers are desperate to show they can deliver on tackling illegal migration to the UK before an election - likely next year.But so far the Rwanda scheme, which would see the UK send some asylum seekers to the east African country, has not got off the ground and the timetable is slipping.The first flights were stopped by a European judge in a last minute intervention last year - despite being cleared by UK courts. Since then, the scheme has become bogged down in legal action. The UK's Court of Appeal ruled against the plan last month, to the surprise of the Home Office.There will now be an appeal in the Supreme Court in the autumn, but senior ministers are privately unsure about whether they can overturn the ruling.They fear that even if the government does win, it could take many months for deportations to begin because individual legal challenges will take place too. Alternative plans are being considered, but they would also face legal challenges and take time to deliver. That is likely to lead to further debate about whether the UK needs to take further action to ensure the policy is delivered.Legislation passed in recent weeks will put a legal obligation on the government to remove people who have entered the country illegally.But without comprehensive returns agreements - and with the Rwanda policy stuck in the courts - it is unclear when ministers will trigger the implementation of that responsibility. The government also now has the power to ignore certain ECHR interim injunctions relating to border security. But some Conservative MPs wanted the government to go further and remove itself from other ECHR obligations.A cabinet minister said events could make it ""inevitable"" the Conservatives end up backing leaving the ECHR.  Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused the Conservatives of going after headlines and ""failing to tackle the crisis"".She told the BBC: ""All of this rhetoric is making it harder to get the kinds of agreements that we need with France, with other European countries, to actually tackle this problem and prevent these dangerous crossings in the first place.""Some backbenchers have said the Conservatives should campaign to leave at the next election regardless of what happens with the Rwanda scheme.Jonathan Gullis said: ""Time and again we see the quasi-legislative European Court of Human Rights continue to undermine the government's plan to stop the boats.""He added the electorate should be given a choice over ECHR withdrawal at the next election. But a former cabinet minister - strongly opposed to withdrawal - described the idea as ""knee jerk nonsense"".They said those who backed quitting were a ""minority"" and there would be significant opposition in cabinet.

Mr Sunak said he would tighten the definition of who qualifies for asylum and introduce a cap on refugee numbers. Ms Truss said she would extend the UK's Rwanda asylum plan and increase the number of Border Force staff.More than 14,000 migrants have crossed the Channel to the UK on small boats so far this year.In an attempt to deter the crossings, in April the government announced it would send some asylum seekers deemed to have entered the UK illegally to Rwanda to claim refuge there.However, no asylum seekers have been sent to the east-African country yet following a series of legal challenges.The UK stands to lose the £120m it has paid to Rwanda if the plan is ruled unlawful by the courts at an upcoming hearing.Both leadership hopefuls said they would explore similar deals with other countries.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told the Mail on Sunday the Rwanda policy was the right approach and that she was determined to ""see it through to full implementation"".Ms Truss also said that if she became Tory Party leader and prime minister, she would increase Border Force staffing from 9,000 to 10,800.She has also promised a strengthened UK bill of rights, adding: ""I'm determined to end the appalling people trafficking we're seeing.""Why do migrants leave France for the UK?Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda?How many people cross the Channel?Former chancellor Mr Sunak has also pledged to do ""whatever it takes"" to make the Rwanda scheme work and described the UK's migration policy as ""broken"" and ""chaotic"".His plans would see the UK re-assessing aid, trade terms and visa options on the basis of a country's willingness to co-operate with the return of failed asylum seekers and offenders.He has also promised to give Parliament control over how many come to the UK by creating an annual cap on the number of refugees accepted each year, though this could be changed in the case of emergencies.And he said he would introduce ""enhanced powers"" to detain, tag and monitor those entering the UK illegally.He said: ""Right now the system is chaotic, with law-abiding citizens seeing boats full of illegal immigrants coming from the safe country of France with our sailors and coastguards seemingly powerless to stop them.""Getty / ReutersMigration and tax plans are the latest issues to emerge in the Tory Party leadership contestBut shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper criticised the pair's proposals, saying they were wasting taxpayers' money on the Rwanda scheme.She said: ""The Conservatives have been in power for 12 years. It beggars belief that they claim to be the ones to sort things out when they have both failed for so long.""Last month, 47 people were told they would be flown to Rwanda, with a flight booked for 14 June. But after a series of legal challenges the flight was cancelled.Another flight has not yet been scheduled.Earlier this week, a Commons select committee cast doubt on the effectiveness of the scheme, saying there was ""no clear evidence"" it would stop risky Channel crossings. .On Saturday, the two candidates clashed over their tax plans.Ms Truss rejected Mr Sunak's criticism that it would be wrong to raise government borrowing to fund tax cuts - a major policy difference between the candidates.She is pledging around £30bn in immediate tax cuts, arguing they will boost growth, while Mr Sunak has said immediate cuts could fuel already-soaring inflation.Conservative Party members are due to start receiving ballot papers this week and the winner will be announced on 5 September.Mr Sunak, who quit as part of the government mutiny against Boris Johnson, topped the MPs' ballots to qualify for the final run-off with Ms Truss. But polls currently suggest the foreign secretary is the favoured candidate of party members, who decide the leader.It is thought a significant chunk of the 160,000 or so Tory members will vote in the coming weeks.Hustings will take place throughout July and August, and the two candidates will square off in a live BBC TV debate on Monday, followed by another hosted by The Sun and TalkTV on Tuesday.BENEATH THE SURFACE: Five underwater cities from around the worldBATS V.

"8 December 2023","Robert Jenrick immigration minister job divided in two","Robert Jenrick immigration minister job divided in two8 December 2023ShareChas GeigerPolitical reporterShareMichael Tomlinson Michael Tomlinson will be responsible for combating illegal immigrationFormer immigration minister Robert Jenrick's job has been divided into two roles in a mini-reshuffle.  Rishi Sunak has appointed Michael Tomlinson as illegal migration minister, while Tom Pursglove will have responsibility for legal migration. Both backed Brexit in the referendum. Mr Tomlinson, who has been replaced as solicitor general by Robert Courts, will be responsible for steering the government's new Rwanda bill through the Commons. Like Mr Jenrick - who resigned on Wednesday describing the bill as ""a triumph of hope over experience"" - he will attend cabinet. Downing Street said the immigration brief had been split into two roles in recognition of the significant work and action that was taking place on both sides of the job - legal and illegal. Get behind my Rwanda plan, Sunak tells ToriesPM will fail on Rwanda Bill - Braverman  Robert Jenrick resigns over Rwanda migrant bill Mr Jenrick argued the Rwanda legislation did not go far enough, and that ""stronger protections"" were needed to end ""the merry-go-round of legal challenges which risk paralysing the scheme"".Amid fresh turmoil in the Conservative Party over the issue, the prime minister called a news conference at Downing Street where he urged Tory MPs to back his new plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country.He argued the new bill was the ""toughest immigration law ever"" and blocked ""every single reason that has ever been used to prevent flights to Rwanda from taking off"".He also said it was the ""only approach"" that would prevent further legal challenges stopping these flights. A former barrister and minor county cricketer, Mr Tomlinson has been MP for Mid Dorset and North Poole since 2015. He spent nearly 18 months as deputy chairman of the European Research Group, a group of Conservative MPs who played a key role in blocking Theresa May's Brexit deal and bringing her down as prime minister. Richard TownshendTom Pursglove will be in charge of legal migrationNow 46, he has served in the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak since 2020, and became solicitor general for England and Wales in September last year.Mr Pursglove, now Minister of State for Legal Migration and Delivery, was previously minister for disabled people, and has also held a junior immigration brief and served as crime and policing minister. First elected as MP for Corby in 2015, at the age of 26. he was the youngest Conservative in the Commons. In 2007, he had - aged 18 - become the youngest councillor in the country, when he was elected to Wellingborough Borough Council, also in Northamptonshire. Last week, Downing Street said it had full confidence in Mr Pursglove, after he was pictured canvassing with suspended MP Peter Bone. Days earlier, Mr Bone had been suspended from the Commons and the Tory Party there after a report by Parliament's Independent Expert Panel found he had bullied and been sexually inappropriate around a staff member. He has denied the allegations.  Labour said Mr Pursglove's behaviour called ""into serious question"" how seriously the party was taking the allegations against Mr Bone.Mr Courts previously chaired the Commons defence committee and was a junior transport minister under Boris Johnson. He has been MP for Witney since 2016, when David Cameron resigned as an MP following the Brexit referendum.

With 557,000 people emigrating from the country, leaving a net migration figure of 606,000.Ms Braverman will have deliberately chosen provocative language for her keynote conference speech. Her description of potential migration as a coming ""hurricane"" is likely to draw particular criticism, including from Labour and those who disagreed with her recent speech to a US think tank, in which she questioned whether the application of the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention is ""fit for our modern age"". Addressing the American Enterprise Institute, she warned that countries faced an ""existential"" threat unless they were able to control their borders. Former justice secretary Robert Buckland said politicians needed to be responsible about language, saying: ""I think talking about hurricanes or weather extremes isn't helpful unless you explain the why.""We know what's happening in the world, with climate change, with war in the sub-Saharan part of Africa - we are seeing mass movements of population, there is no doubt about that. ""But we need to talk about the why before we start using alarmist language. Let's do so in a way that really understands the breadth of the problem.""Another Conservative MP, Alicia Kearns, said: ""I recognise there are legitimate concerns but I think we have to be very careful we don't create a situation where we are either demonising minorities or those who are vulnerable.""Speaking shortly before Ms Braverman, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk announced that the government would explore options to to rent out prison spaces in foreign countries for prisoners who cannot be accommodated in UK prisons.Heckler expelled from hallThe speech also saw a fellow Tory politician kicked out of the conference hall for heckling her, after she described ""gender ideology"" as ""poison"".Andrew Boff, a Conservative member of the London Assembly, was filmed describing the comments as ""trash"", before being escorted out of the conference hall by security.The incident came during a section of the speech in which she said that ""gender ideology, white privilege, anti-British history"" had become ""embedded"" in corporate Britain and parts of the public sector.Speaking to the BBC after being removed, Mr Boff, a patron of the LGBT+ Conservative group, called her comments ""disgusting"", adding he hoped they don't ""become part of the rhetoric"" in the run-up to the next general election.Mr Buckland has since said Mr Boff has had his conference pass removed - but the home secretary has called for him to be ""forgiven and let back into conference"".Mr Buckland questioned the security response, adding he hoped the situation could be resolved.

And the so-called European Research Group (ERG) - an influential group of Brexiteer MPs on the right wing of the party.The groups may be familiar to those who remember the tumultuous Brexit days, and the headache they gave former Prime Minister Theresa May as she tried, and ultimately failed, to appease them both.Three prime ministers later, and both groups are back at the centre of another political whirlwind.Legal adviceWith the Rwanda bill due back in Parliament next week, both groups are taking legal advice before deciding whether to back it, or move against it.Enter the ERG's Star Chamber, who, we're told, are studying the bill ""forensically"".They feel Robert Jenrick's resignation as immigration minister was very significant and are not expected to give a judgement on whether they'll vote for or against the bill, or try change it, for a few days. Many worry it leaves the government too open to individual appeals by asylum seekers, with the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg still able to challenge deportations.The One Nation group of MPs are being given legal advice by Lord Garnier, a former government solicitor general.His verdict? ""I won't vote for it [in the House of Lords],"" Lord Garnier told the BBC.""It's an extraordinary bill - it's trying to define things when there is no evidence for that being the case. It's rather like a bill that has decided that all dogs are cats.""1:20Watch: My patience with Rwanda plan has worn thin - SunakThe bill compels judges to treat Rwanda as a safe country and gives ministers the powers to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act.Mr Sunak said the bill addresses the concerns of the Supreme Court, which ruled the Rwanda scheme unlawful last month.Lord Garnier isn't so sure: ""It makes political nonsense and it makes legal nonsense.""The group that's taking legal advice from Lord Garnier are nervous and share these concerns too.Again, their position on whether to back the bill or not - or try to change it - is still undecided and it's likely they'll come to a conclusion in the coming days.Rebellion loomsThe bill is set to get its second reading in Parliament on Tuesday, when MPs will get to vote on it. Some may wait until later stages of the bill's passage to rebel or amend the draft law.Mr Sunak has indicated that if Tory MPs do vote against the bill, they would not be thrown out of the party.The vote next Tuesday, Mr Sunak said, was about ""confidence in Parliament to demonstrate that it gets the British people's frustration"", not confidence in his government.This all has quite an air of 2018 about it, when Mrs May found herself at the centre of rebellions from different sides over her Brexit legislation.Some MPs fear Mr Sunak is repeating what they see as the mistakes of the past.As one MP put it, his news conference earlier seemed to be ""channelling Theresa May"" to talk to MPs via the television - rather than more effectively in person.The unheeded ultimatums and the mutinous spirit that brought down Mrs May and other previous Tory prime ministers haunt Mr Sunak at a moment of political peril.At the news conference, Mr Sunak was asked if he was telling Tory MPs to ""back me or sack me"", a phrase used by former Tory Prime Minister John Major when he faced a leadership challenge in 1995.In his answer, Mr Sunak may have done something rare these days and spoken for his whole party when he said: ""My patience with this has worn thin.""Get behind my Rwanda plan, Sunak tells ToriesPM will fail on Rwanda Bill - BravermanCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Refugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67655718"

Sir Matthew Rycroft said another payment of £50m was expected next year.The revelation came hours after Rishi Sunak vowed to ""finish the job"" of reviving the plan after the resignation of his immigration minister this week.Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Sunak’s Rwanda law at mercy of Tory factionsGet behind my Rwanda plan, Sunak tells ToriesWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing and potentially resettlement, in order to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats, was first announced by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022.'Something to hide'But it has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent from the UK so far.Until now it was known that the government had spent at least £140m on the policy. Sir Matthew had previously refused to disclose updated figures, saying ministers had decided to set out the costs annually.The figures were disclosed in a letter to Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the home affairs select committee and and her fellow Labour Dame Meg Hiller, who chairs spending watchdog the public accounts committee.Dame Meg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the full cost of the policy so far had only been revealed after repeated inquiries.""It almost looks like the government's got something to hide,"" she said. Sir Matthew stressed that the extra payments were not linked to the new treaty signed this week between UK and Rwanda as part of the government's attempt to amend the policy, which was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last month.Downing Street has said the costs associated with the deal were set out in the original agreement with Rwanda and that it was always going to involve ""additional funding"".Legal migration minister Tom Pursglove said the money was being spent to ensure the Rwanda policy was ""robust"". He added that the scheme was ""key"" to reducing the amount the government spends on housing migrants in UK hotels - currently £8m a day.Robert Jenrick's immigration minister role was split into two following his resignation. Michael Tomlinson is the illegal migration minister.Labour branded the revelation of the extra costs ""incredible"", with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper adding: ""How many more blank cheques will Rishi Sunak write before the Tories come clean about this scheme being a total farce?""""It's basically £100m for every home secretary trip to Rwanda,"" she said. The Home Office has said Rwanda has an initial capacity to take 200 people a year, but there are plans to increase that number when the scheme begins. The department has also estimated the cost of sending someone to a safe country - not specifically Rwanda - is £169,000, compared to £106,000 if they remain in the UK.Legal challenges Earlier on Thursday, Mr Sunak held a press conference where he urged Tory MPs to back his plan.The prime minister was speaking a day after immigration minister Robert Jenrick resigned over the government's revised policy, saying he believed it was destined for failure. Mr Sunak insisted the new emergency legislation set out by the government would end the ""merry-go-round of legal challenges"" over the flights of some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The bill compels judges to treat Rwanda as a safe country and gives ministers the powers to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act. But it does not go as far as allowing them to dismiss the European Convention on Human Rights, as some on the right of the Conservative Party have called for.The bill faces opposition from MPs in different factions of the Conservative Party when it returns to Parliament next week. Also on Thursday, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman reiterated that it would fail to ""stop the boats"" and called on the government to fully exclude international law. The Times has reported that senior government lawyers had warned No 10 the emergency legislation could still allow migrants to lodge challenges against their removal to Rwanda. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Pursglove insisted the legislation would ""close off the routes to try to frustrate the appeals process"". On Sky News he said ministers would ""engage constructively with parliamentarians around any concerns that they have"".

In a joint resignation letter, Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith said they had previously argued that ""safeguards"" were needed to ensure the legislation was ""watertight"". ""It is therefore important in terms of credibility that we are consistent with this,"" they added. The Tory MPs said they had supported rebel amendments to the Rwanda bill ""not because we are against the legislation, but because like everyone else we want it to work"". Mr Anderson told GB News that while most of the bill was ""sound"", it needed ""beefing up"". ""I can't be in a position to vote for something which I don't believe in,"" he added. Asked if he would vote against the bill as a whole on Wednesday, he said: ""We'll see what happens over the next 24 hours. ""There's a lot of discussions going to happen behind closed doors.""'Toughest legislation'Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith both represent so-called ""red wall"" seats previously held by Labour and have been outspoken on the need to tackle illegal immigration. With strong support from the right of the party, there had been speculation the prime minister would choose not to sack them as they held party, not government, positions. But in their letter, they acknowledged their ""important roles"" meant they were bound by collective responsibility - so are expected to vote with the government or resign. Labour said the resignations showed Mr Sunak was ""too weak to lead his party and too weak to lead the country"". ""These resignations show that even senior Tories think that the Conservatives have failed and is yet more evidence of the total Tory chaos over their failing Rwanda gimmick - yet they are still making the taxpayer pay the extortionate price,"" the party's national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, said.A Downing Street source said: ""This is the toughest legislation ever brought before Parliament to tackle illegal migration.""This bill will make it clear that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay.

Sir Bill's proposal, which aimed to prevent any international law being used to block someone being removed to Rwanda, was defeated by 529 votes to 68. Senior Tories including former Home Secretary Mrs Braverman, former Prime Minister Liz Truss and former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith were among those voting in favour.

"16 January 2024","Tory deputy chairmen back move to 'beef up' Rwanda bill","Tory deputy chairmen back move to 'beef up' Rwanda bill16 January 2024ShareKate Whannel & Sam FrancisPolitical reporters, BBC NewsSharePA MediaPM Rishi Sunak is facing a blow to his authority as two deputy Conservative chairmen said they would back rebel amendments to his flagship Rwanda bill. Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith join more than 60 right-wing Tory MPs backing changes to the bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday. The bill seeks to revive the PM's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.The work and pensions secretary said all Tory MPs want the plan to succeed.Mell Stride said: ""We all have the same aim here to deliver a robust bill.""There are very strong feelings about this legislation and that is understandable, because we all passionately in the Tory party want to deliver a deterrent that is going to stop boats.""Former prime minister Boris Johnson, who originally launched the Rwanda scheme, has backed amendments tabled by right-wing rebels.In a social media post, he said: ""This bill must be as legally robust as possible.""Conservative MP Miriam Cates, who has tabled 16 of the amendments, said she would be willing to vote the Rwanda Bill down if Rishis Sunak does not accept her changes. Ms Cates, who chairs the New Conservatives group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I would be prepared [to vote against the bill]. But what I really want to see is the government to accept these amendments.""She said that defeat for the government at that stage could still mean the Rwanda policy gets going before the general election later this year.Sunak gears up for battle on Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Tory MPs pile pressure on Sunak over Rwanda bill  Migrant crossings fell in 2023, official data saysMr Anderson said he agreed with ""90% of the bill"" but wanted it ""beefed up"".""This is not a rebellion,"" Mr Anderson told GB News. ""We just feel that there's a few areas in the bill that could be tightened up to make sure that it's watertight.""As deputy chairmen, Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith are expected to support government bills, though they do not hold government roles.The proposed amendments are not expected to pass, as both the government and opposition parties are likely to vote them down.If the amendments are rejected, rebel backbenchers will have to decide whether or not to support the bill, without the changes they want. Just 29 Tory MPs voting against the bill on Wednesday could derail the legislation.However, asked if he would vote against it without any changes, Mr Clarke-Smith said: ""Not necessarily… We have to weigh that up at the time.""PA/Daily ExpressRishi Sunak reiterated his desire to get his Safety of Rwanda Bill passed while on a visit to Leigh-on-Sea, EssexIn a bid to deter people from trying to get to the UK across the Channel in small boats, the government wants to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Labour has criticised the policy as an expensive ""gimmick"" and says it would prioritise tackling the smuggling gangs. The government's Rwanda policy was blocked by the Supreme Court on the grounds of concerns about the safety of the east African country. Following the court decision, the government introduced the Safety of Rwanda Bill which states that in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country.It also allows ministers to ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard.The plans have been criticised from both sides of the Conservative Party, with those on the right fearing it would not prevent legal challenges, while MPs from the party's One Nation group are concerned that any hardening of the bill would risk breaking international law. Robert Jenrick - who resigned as immigration minister last year - and veteran MP Sir Bill Cash have tabled a number of amendments to the bill aimed at restricting an individual's ability to block their own removal and allowing human rights law to be bypassed.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Jenrick has said that, over the last 30 years, successive governments have shown ""complete disdain"" for voters' concerns about immigration. ""This is utterly corrosive to trust in democratic politics, and in an election year when the British public has their chance to mark our work, it is a recipe for electoral wipeout,"" he said.Damian Green, chairman of the One Nation group, said: ""We've made our position clear. For all our reservations...we want the government to carry it through unamended.""Former Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said he supported the government's wish to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda but changes were needed. He told BBC Radio 4 Today programme the bill would benefit from being ""much simpler"" and from removing clauses which seek to limit the jurisdiction of the courts.'Get destroyed'Other Conservative MPs, including Sir Simon Clarke, Mark Francois, Sir John Hayes and Danny Kruger - as well as former home secretary Suella Braverman - have suggested they could oppose the entire bill if changes are not made. Sir Simon told BBC Politics Live that if left unamended there was ""every reason"" to believe it would ""fail on contact with reality"".He warned that if the bill did not work, the Conservatives would ""get destroyed"" in the general election, expected to take place this year.Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch has not denied a report in The Times that she privately warned the plans did not go far enough.The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said the Rwanda plan was ""not compatible"" with international refugee law in a new assessment.The UNHCR, the UN's Refugee Agency, has also said the revived plan ""does not meet the required standards relating to the legality and appropriateness of the transfer of asylum seekers and is not compatible with international refugee law"".It comes after a YouGov opinion poll indicated the Conservatives were on course for huge losses in the election. The polling, reported by the Telegraph, suggests the party could be reduced to just 169 seats.

"29 November 2023","Fact-checking claims about the government's migration policies","Fact-checking claims about the government's migration policies29 November 2023ShareAnthony Reuben, Tamara Kovacevic and Lucy GilderBBC VerifyShareUK Parliament/Jessica TaylorThe government has been defending its immigration policies after the release of high migration figures and the Supreme Court's ruling against its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. We've looked at some of the claims being made.'Recent estimates of immigration show that it's slowing' - Rishi SunakSpeaking at prime minister's questions, Mr Sunak was referring to official migration figures released on 23 November.They show net migration of 672,000 people for the year to the end of June 2023.That figure was up from 607,000 for the year to the end of June 2022, but down from 745,000 for the whole of 2022.Net migration is the number of people arriving in the UK who plan to stay for at least a year, minus the people leaving for at least a year.The Office for National Statistics, which released the figures, said ""while it is too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend, these more recent estimates indicate a slowing of immigration"".The figure is nonetheless at a historically high level - Mr Sunak has described it as ""far too high"".The Conservatives' manifesto in 2019 promised that ""overall numbers will come down"". In the year that pledge was made, net migration ended up at 184,000.UK net migration in 2022 revised up to record 745,000'[Labour's plan is] a cosy deal with the EU, which would see the UK accept 100,000 illegal migrants' - Rishi SunakRishi Sunak criticised the Labour leader's plan to stop small boats coming to the UK.Keir Starmer has said he would negotiate a returns agreement with EU countries to send back some failed asylum seekers - if Labour wins power.Mr Sunak's claim is based on an assumption that Labour would have to take 13% of all asylum seekers arriving in the EU as part of such an agreement.The Conservatives have said this is because the EU has a policy of sharing asylum seekers between countries based on population size. They say this would mean the UK taking over 100,000 of them a year.But although the EU has been discussing for years how to share responsibility for refugees, no deal based on population is in place.Labour has said it would not - and could not - sign up to an EU quota scheme because the UK is not a member state, so any agreement would have to be outside that.PA Media'The number of crossings is down by a third' - Rishi SunakThe prime minister was talking about small boat crossings. He's made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five key pledges in government, which we've been tracking. As at 13 November, 27,284 people had been detected crossing the English Channel in 2023, according to the Home Office.At the same point in 2022, almost 42,000 people had been detected, so the number crossing is indeed down by a third.'The government has never succeeded in actually getting a successor to what was known as the Dublin III agreement, which meant that people here with no right to be here could then be removed' - Nick Thomas-SymondsMr Thomas-Symonds - a Labour MP - was speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live after the Supreme Court's judgement on 15 November.He was referring to an EU scheme - Dublin III - which allows member states to return failed asylum seekers to other EU countries, taking into consideration factors such as family reunion and irregular entry.The scheme ended in the UK after Brexit in January 2021.But Home Office data shows the numbers involved were pretty small and actually more people ended up coming to the UK under this scheme than were removed in the final six years it was operating in the UK.From 2015 to end of 2020, 3,961 people were transferred to the UK and only 1,763 were removed under the scheme.PA Media'The UNHCR processes Libyan refugees in Rwanda' - Jacob Rees-MoggMr Rees-Mogg defended the government's Rwanda scheme on BBC Question Time on 23 November.Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulHe said that the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) processes refugees in Rwanda. He argued the government's plan was ""not that outrageous a thing to do, otherwise the UNHCR, which doesn't want the UK to do it, wouldn't be doing it itself"".It is true that the UNHCR, with financial support from the EU, has transferred refugees from Libya to Rwanda under a scheme called the Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM).However, the ETM is voluntary, not compulsory, like the UK's plan. The ETM offers vulnerable refugees, taken into detention by the Libyan authorities, a choice to have their application processed in Rwanda.Libya - a major transit route for those hoping to reach Europe - is not considered a safe country for refugees.People moved from Libya to Rwanda by the UNHCR are given assistance to resettle elsewhere should they choose to do so. It says that ""as of March 2023, 932 refugees from the ETM centre have been resettled to Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and USA"".'Some 20,000 people have been returned this year' - Rishi SunakThe prime minister was talking about the number of people who have been returned to other countries from the UK.Mr Sunak did not make clear what type of return he was referring to, but the combination of voluntary and enforced returns this year does add up to about 20,000. The latest data shows that 5,095 people were forcibly removed from the UK between January and October 2023. A further 15,204 left the country voluntarily in the same period. About a fifth of the 20,299 people returned so far in 2023 were Albanians. Not all of the 20,000 people returned were failed asylum seekers - some of them were foreign national offenders.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Refugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakPrime Minister's QuestionsBBC Verify","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67431602"
"13 January 2024","Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill","Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill13 January 2024ShareChas GeigerPolitical reporterSharePARishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation.  More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill.  The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful.  Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"".The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny.   Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda billSunak had doubts over Rwanda plan, papers suggestCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats.""   Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill.""Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"".  Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said.The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total.PA MediaA group of people thought to be migrants are brought into Dungeness, KentIt argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations.Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party.  Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. 'Gimmick'The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard.But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed.They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights.The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs.  'Safe routes'  The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes.  Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"".No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added.In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added.Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"".""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.

The legislation comfortably passed its first Commons hurdle with a majority of 44, but there will be further votes in the new year.No Tory MPs voted against but some critics on the right of the party rebelled by abstaining.Rebels said they had been told the PM would consider ""tightening"" the bill.But this could risk losing the support of more centrist Tory MPs, who have warned they would oppose any future changes which would breach international law. The emergency legislation was drawn up to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The government say the scheme is designed to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats - something Mr Sunak has made one of his key priorities.Chris Mason: Sunak takes the win but the battle is not overWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?In a sign of nerves in Downing Street over the potential for a tight result, Climate Minister Graham Stuart flew back from the COP28 climate conference in Dubai to vote. But despite some Tories on the right threatening to vote against the bill, in the end only opposition MPs did, and the bill passed by 313 votes to 269. Around 29 Conservative MPs -  including former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the legislation last week, and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - chose to abstain and not support the bill. Altogether 37 Tory MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining. Shortly before the vote, five factions of backbench MPs - the European Research Group (ERG), the New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group, the Conservative Growth Group and Northern Research Group - announced they could not support the bill in its current form. They plan to propose amendments and said they could vote the bill down when it returns to the Commons in the new year if the changes they wanted were not accepted.Chairman of the ERG - a faction to the right of the party - Mark Francois, who was among those who abstained, told BBC News: ""Our objection was that we don't believe, as it's currently drafted, the bill is firm enough to ensure that flights will take off to Rwanda.""""The prime minister had said that he would entertain tightening up the bill. We're taking him at his word,"" he said.""A number of MPs voted with the government... because they were told in private that there would be amendments later on.""However, agreeing to their demands would create new problems for the government. The centrist One Nation group, which includes more than 100 Tory MPs, had recommended that its members vote for the bill, but warned it would oppose any future amendments ""that would mean the UK government breaching the rule of law and its international obligations"".Group member Matt Warman told the BBC's World Tonight programme: ""We don't want to see the bill change in a way that goes over the red lines of international law… anything that goes over those red lines is out of the question"". He added that ""there is a possibility for sensible compromise as we go into the next stages of this bill"".Tougher legislation may be more difficult to get through the House of Lords.

"7 December 2023","New Rwanda bill gives ministers power to disregard some human rights law","New Rwanda bill gives ministers power to disregard some human rights law7 December 2023ShareBecky Morton & Dominic CascianiBBC NewsSharePA MediaA draft law, which aims to enable the government's flagship Rwanda policy to go ahead, gives ministers the power to disregard some human rights law.The government said the bill, which will be introduced in Parliament on Thursday, made clear in UK law Rwanda was a safe country for asylum seekers. But it does not go as far as some Conservative MPs on the right of the party had called for. The legislation aims to address the concerns of the Supreme Court. Last month, the UK's highest court ruled that the plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were unlawful.The policy, which was first announced by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022, aims to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats.But it has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far.  Tory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The bill, which must be voted on by Parliament, orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act in an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court's existing judgment. It also orders the courts to ignore other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - that stand in the way of deportations to Rwanda.However, it does not go as far as some Tory MPs wanted.  Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and her supporters had called for it to override the entire Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Refugee Convention, and all other international law.'Fatally flawed' The bill allows ministers to ignore any emergency order from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to temporarily halt a flight to Rwanda while an individual case is still being considered.But it stops short of disapplying the whole of the ECHR. It also allows migrants to legally challenge their removal to Rwanda on specific individual grounds, if they can prove that being put on a plane would leave them at real risk of serious harm.A source close to Mrs Braverman said the bill was ""fatally flawed"" and would be ""bogged down in the courts for months and months"". ""The prime minister has kept the ability for every single illegal migrant to make individual human rights claims against their removal and to then appeal those claims if they don't succeed at first,"" the source said.""It is a further betrayal of Tory voters and the decent patriotic majority who want to see this insanity brought to an end.""The government said the bill would ""end the merry-go-round of legal challenges"" preventing asylum seekers being removed to Rwanda. However, the draft legislation concedes that it may not be compatible with minimum human rights safeguards.Legislation rarely goes before MPs with such a legal warning. It means lawyers have told ministers the measures could still be legally challenged - and the Supreme Court could find them incompatible with human rights obligations and therefore unworkable.Rwanda's foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta said the country would not be able to continue with the scheme ""without lawful behaviour by the UK"". He said: ""It has always been important to both Rwanda and the UK that our rule of law partnership meets the highest standards of international law, and it places obligations on both the UK and Rwanda to act lawfully.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""Through this new landmark emergency legislation, we will control our borders, deter people taking perilous journeys across the Channel and end the continuous legal challenges filling our courts.""Home Secretary James Cleverly signed a new treaty with Rwanda on Tuesday. The government hopes the treaty, combined with the new bill, will be enough to allow the Rwanda scheme to go ahead.Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the next election.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government and the Conservative Party were in ""total chaos"".""They've got open warfare among their backbenches, the starting gun fired on the next leadership election and once again the whole country paying the price for this chaos,"" she told the Commons.Braverman: Tories face oblivion if Rwanda bill failsTory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationImmigrationRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67641805"

The bill would make clear in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country and give ministers the power to ignore emergency injunctions, so that deportations can begin.The bill now going through Parliament aims to prevent further legal challenges to the one-way flights, which were ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court in November last year, but won majority support from MPs in the Commons last month.The prime minister has made stopping migrant crossings of the Channel in small boats one of his five priorities.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda plan flawed at core says cross-party reportSunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billWednesday's debate marks the second of three days of committee stage in the Lords, where peers comb through the draft legislation line by line. They have nearly 100 amendments to consider.After votes on amendments at report stage - the next stage of the bill - peers will have the chance to hold a final vote before sending the legislation back to MPs to consider further.On Monday, Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti warned the bill ""threatens both the domestic rule of law, especially the separation of powers, and the international rules-based order"".Former Conservative party leader Lord Howard countered that the Supreme Court judgement was a ""finding of opinion"" and suggested the government was therefore correct to override it where necessary.But Tory peer Lord Tugendhat, whose nephew is security minister Tom Tugendhat, said: ""What we are being asked to do really represents the sort of behaviour that the world associates with despots and autocracies, not with an established democracy, not with the mother of Parliaments.""Independent peer Lord Alton of Liverpool said that simply legislating Rwanda is safe ""doesn't make it so"".""Saying a dog is a cat doesn't make it such. It may be your opinion but it isn't true.""Speaking on a visit to Scotland, Lord Cameron said: ""Rwanda is a safe country in our view, they have made huge steps forward over recent years, they look after many refugees in Rwanda very well.""And we need to get this bill through Parliament, get some of these flights away to demonstrate that this country is not going to put up with large-scale illegal migration.""What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda Bill criticised by peers in first Lords debateSunak sees off Tory rebels as MPs back Rwanda billSunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billTory deputy chairs resign to rebel over Rwanda billWhat is the Rwanda vote about?

The former immigration minister is leading Tory efforts to rewrite the legislation in the House of Commons.Rishi Sunak says it is already the toughest immigration law ever proposed.But Tory rebels say it will not work in its current form and fulfil the prime minister's much-delayed pledge to start sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.""The test of whether it works is not can we get a few symbolic flights off in the months ahead, with a small number of illegal migrants on them,"" Mr Jenrick told the Commons. Instead, he said it needed to create ""a sustainable deterrent"" to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats. Follow live: MPs debate Rwanda billTory deputy chairs back move to 'beef up' Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Analysis: Tory divisions on show as Rwanda votes loomAmendments tabled by Mr Jenrick - who resigned as immigration minister last year over the legislation - and veteran Conservative Sir Bill Cash are among those which are being considered by MPs. They aim to restrict an individual's ability to block their removal to Rwanda and prevent international law being considered in legal challenges against the policy. Mr Jenrick told MPs the proposals ""seek to address the evident flaws of the bill"" and ""represent the last opportunity for us to get this policy right"". He argued the current bill left open loopholes which would allow individuals to challenge their deportation on the basis that Rwanda would not be safe for them specifically, even if it was deemed a safe country overall. More than 60 Tory MPs are backing the amendments including two deputy Conservative chairmen - Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith. However, they are not expected to pass as both the government and opposition parties are likely to vote them down.The bigger test for the government will be a vote expected on Wednesday, when the rebels could vote against the entire bill. If around 30 Tory MPs joined opposition parties in voting against the legislation it could be defeated. Earlier, Mr Jenrick told Sky News he was prepared to vote against the bill if it was not improved. At least three other Tory MPs - including former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - have publicly said the same, with reports that more could join them.The government's Rwanda policy was blocked by the Supreme Court on the grounds of concerns about the safety of the east African country for asylum seekers. Following the court decision, the government introduced the Safety of Rwanda Bill which states that in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country.Labour's shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock described the Rwanda policy as ""unaffordable, unworkable and unlawful"". He urged MPs to back Labour's amendments to the legislation ""in the interests of damage limitation"". These include ensuring that courts can consider the risk of refoulement - where asylum seekers are returned to a country where they face persecution - when making decisions on removals to Rwanda. Court capacityAhead of the debate in the Commons, the government announced plans to expand court capacity and train 150 judges to run a new fast-track appeals system for Rwanda deportations. The extra resources are designed to deal with criticism from some Conservative MPs that individual appeals against deportation to Rwanda will clog up the courts and should be disallowed entirely.Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the changes will free up 5,000 additional sitting days to hear asylum cases.Judges will receive additional training and will be paid more to sit on evenings and weekends. The government has also created 25 additional hearing rooms to deal with cases.However, a Tory rebel source said the government ""seem to be conceding the courts will be overwhelmed with migrants' individual claims"".

Andrew RT Davies has voiced differences of opinion to his UK party leader before, notably over his support for Brexit when David Cameron was prime minister, and more recently over Covid passes.More generally Mr Davies and his colleagues in the Senedd have been supportive of Boris Johnson's government, even during some of the more difficult moments around lockdown party allegations.

""They're women and children.""How can we say that we need to do checks on women and children?""They are desperate, absolutely desperate to come here.""Earlier on Wednesday, UK Conservative Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said that 760 visas have so far been granted to Ukrainians seeking to join family in the UK, up from 300 reported on Tuesday.Mr Shapps said the government now had ""a lot more"" visa application slots available - with 6,000 now available a day - and that the government had ""massively expanded up the number of processing locations.""Numbers 'will rise sharply'Later Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the Commons the numbers of visas provided ""are nearly a thousand"" and will ""rise very sharply"".""We expect those numbers to rise to in the region of the hundreds of thousands,"" he said.""We understand how much refugees have to give to this country and we understand how much this country has to gain from welcoming refugees, and we will be generous and we are being generous.""1:31Watch: Moments of human connection amid the Ukraine warMark Drakeford called for the task of providing visas to be taken away from the Home Office.Speaking at the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, he said: ""The Home Office with its long history of hostile regimes to people coming from elsewhere in the world... the responsibility should be taken away from a department that has demonstrated its incapacity to mobilise and meet that [Ukrainian] response.""The first minister called for security checks to be carried out on Ukrainian refugees once they have arrived in the UK rather than before.In the Senedd, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called it ""morally untenable"" for the UK to continue imports of Russian oil until the end of the year.""We need nothing less than a full energy embargo immediately now,"" he said.""It will be painful, we understand that but it's technically and economically possible.""Senedd voteIn a Senedd debate on Wednesday, Welsh Labour ministers and Plaid Cymru called for an ""expedited visa process to ensure simple, fast, safe and legal routes to sanctuary"" in a amendment to a Tory motion criticising the invasion.The move was backed by 52 MSs, including the Tory group.The Conservatives opposed a Plaid Cymru amendment calling for all nations to sign a treaty prohibiting nuclear weapons, but the amendment passed with 20 in favour, 15 abstaining and 17 against.The resulting motion, which included calls for nuclear disarmament, was passed by the Senedd with 26 in favour, 13 abstaining and 13 against.

In a blow to the PM's authority, 60 Tory MPs backed rebel amendments. No 10 is confident the bill as a whole will still pass later, but is thought to be preparing to offer concessions.MPs are set to continue debating proposed changes to the legislation - which seeks to deter Channel crossings by reviving the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - in the Commons on Wednesday, with the bill put to a vote afterwards if it remains unamended. If around 30 Tory MPs join opposition parties in voting against the bill at its final Commons hurdle, it could be defeated. So far very few Conservative MPs have explicitly committed to voting against the bill.At least four Conservative MPs - including former ministers Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman - have publicly said they are prepared to vote against the bill if it is not improved. But it is unclear how many more could join them. Follow LIVE updates on the Rwanda bill voteChris Mason: Crunch day for the Rwanda asylum billCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Illegal Migration Minister Michael Tomlinson told BBC Breakfast the Tory rebellion against the policy was a sign of ""constructive and robust debate"". Playing down the scale of Conservative divisions, he said: ""Almost every single person, in fact every single person, who stood up on our side on the Conservative side said they want this scheme to work"". Mr Tomlinson said he was ""very sorry"" that two party deputy chairmen and a parliamentary private secretary resigned, but that ""each and every one of them want this policy to work"". He said there was only ""an inch between us on the Conservative benches"". The illegal migration minister also confirmed the government was ""looking at"" new rules for civil servants, to make it the default assumption that orders from international courts temporarily blocking flights to Rwanda should be ignored.The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, is already pushing back against the idea - saying it will mean officials will be asked to breach international law.On Tuesday, tabled amendments to the bill - which aimed to prevent any international law being used to block someone's removal to Rwanda and severely limit an individual's ability to appeal their deportation - were defeated. But they still secured significant backing from senior Tories, including former home secretary Mrs Braverman and former prime minister Liz Truss. Mr Sunak has so far resisted giving in to the demands of his critics on the right of the party - and if he did, this could risk losing support among more centrist MPs. However, in a bid to appease some of these critics, the government is considering changing the Civil Service Code to include a presumption emergency injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are ignored. The move is part of an attempt to quell the Conservative rebellion over Mr Sunak's Rwanda legislation. Even a government victory would come at a political cost, with debates over the issue exposing the extent of divisions within the Conservative Party.A significant rebellion would also be damaging to the prime minister, who has made the Rwanda policy central to his pledge to stop small boats crossing the Channel.Miriam Cates, one of those who voted for Tuesday's amendments, told the BBC she would ""potentially"" be prepared to vote against the entire bill. ""But we've got 24 hours - that's a long time in politics. We've got more votes tomorrow on more amendments so we're not at that position yet where we can make that decision,"" she said.  If it is approved by MPs, the government still faces a challenge to get it through the Lords, where it is likely to encounter further opposition. How many people cross the Channel in small boats?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?On Tuesday evening, Mr Sunak suffered his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister, when 60 Conservatives defied the government to back changes to the bill put forward by MPs on the right of the party. Shortly before the votes, Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith announced they were resigning to support the amendments. The pair said they were not against the bill but wanted to make sure it was ""watertight"". Ms Stevenson, a parliamentary private secretary in the Department for Business and Trade, also confirmed she had offered her resignation after voting for the rebel amendments.Labour said the resignations showed Mr Sunak was ""too weak to lead his party and too weak to lead the country"".""These resignations show that even senior Tories think that the Conservatives have failed and is yet more evidence of the total Tory chaos over their failing Rwanda gimmick - yet they are still making the taxpayer pay the extortionate price,"" the party's national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, said.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES SCANDALS OF MISS MEXICO 1989: Watch Señorita 89FRIENDS WHO DATE, THEN DON'T, THEN HOOK UP AGAIN: Classic comedy following six twenty-somethings as they live it up in the cityCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Jenrick warns of 'last opportunity' for Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Analysis: Chris Mason on a crunch day for SunakUK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68001727"

Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister said ""we've got a plan, and we're going to get our planes off"".Sir Keir unveiled new details of his plan in Dover alongside local MP Natalie Elphicke, who defected from the Tories to Labour on Wednesday.In a brief speech, Ms Elphicke took a shot at her former boss, claiming ""nowhere is Rishi Sunak's lack of delivery clearer than on the issue of small boats"".How many people cross the Channel in small boats?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In his speech, the Labour leader said he will establish a new Border Security Command to work with Border Force, MI5 and the National Crime Agency on prosecuting gangs operating small boat routes.The party says this new unit would be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief, who would report directly to the home secretary.Sir Keir argued that scrapping the Rwanda scheme would free up £75m in the first year of a Labour government to hire hundreds of extra investigators and ""intelligence agents"".He has already pledged to cancel the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was first announced in 2022 but has been delayed by legal challenges.Ministers hope the scheme, now due to begin in July, will put people off trying to come to the UK across the English Channel in small boats.But Labour argues the scheme will not deter people from trying to make the journey.According to the National Audit Office, payments to Rwanda would cost £370m over five years, plus £120m if more than 300 people are moved, and £20,000 per individual relocated.Pressed on when his party would scrap the scheme, Sir Keir told reporters Labour would ""get rid of the policy straight away"".""I'm not going to continue a policy I don't think is going to work, which is going to cost a fortune,"" he added.0:31Natalie Elphicke: Sunak has failed on small boatsWhen pushed on how large a reduction in small boat crossings he would like to see, the Labour leader did not set a figure but said he wanted levels to come down ""dramatically"". ""We will restore serious government to our borders, tackle this problem at source and replace the Rwanda policy permanently,"" he added.Sir Keir also said his party would expand powers under the Blair-era Terrorism Act to enable police to search people suspected of being involved in people smuggling.There would also be new powers enabling ""live monitoring"" of their financial accounts and court orders to hand over financial information.Suspected smugglers could also see their access to the internet, banking and travel restricted.Labour says these new powers would require fresh legislation to be passed in Parliament - something Sir Keir insisted would happen ""very quickly"".As first reported by The Times, the party also aims to negotiate access to the EU's Eurodac database, which records the fingerprints of people aged 14 and over who arrive in European countries without permission.Labour has not said whether this would involve implementing EU legislation underpinning the scheme. It says this would be a matter to be discussed during the negotiations.Peter Walsh, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said Labour's scheme was ""unlikely to be a game changer"".The plan ""appears on the face of it to be pretty similar"" to the current Small Boats Operational Command - the new military-led force which monitors and intercepts vessels attempting unauthorised entry into the UK via the Channel, he told BBC News.""The devil will be in the detail,"" he added.Both the Conservatives and Labour have accused each other of creating an ""amnesty"" - generally understood to mean allowing all those entering the country illegally to stay with a full legal pardon.Labour's plans, which the Conservatives have dubbed an ""amnesty for illegal immigrants"", will allow those arriving in the UK on small boats to apply for asylum - which is currently banned under the Illegal Migration Act. Labour have repeatedly denied they have plans for an amnesty on those entering the country illegally.Sir Keir accused the Conservatives of ""a Travelodge amnesty"" by not processing asylum claims and housing people in hotels instead - though the plans do not amount an amnesty either as they involve deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda.Nearly 9,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show. This is up almost a third (32%) on the same period last year, when 6,691 people made the crossing, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 when the number of people was 7,750.Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationKeir StarmerImmigrationLabour Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68984778"

Another Tory MP, Henry Smith, called on the Home Office to ""get a grip"".Mr Jenrick said councils should be given at least 24 hours notice of asylum seekers arriving in their area.The immigration minister told the Commons that overcrowding at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent meant his department had to secure alternative accommodation ""at extreme pace"". However, he said in some cases the Home Office had failed to properly engage with councils and MPs.""I have been clear that this is completely unacceptable and that this must change,"" he added. Mr Jenrick said he had sent a letter to MPs setting out minimum requirements, including notifying councils and MPs when hotels had been selected in their area no less than 24 hours before asylum seekers arrived there. What's behind the Home Office migrant backlog?Tory MPs vow to continue naming asylum hotelsDuring an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Hollobone said his local council had raised concerns about the use of a hotel in the area because of mould and a lack of kitchen facilities. He said the local police force had also raised ""serious concerns"" about community safety and the vulnerability of asylum seekers. He said the Home Office and contractor Serco had agreed the hotel would not be used until the issues were addressed. However, he said that on Tuesday the council were told 41 asylum seekers had been moved into the hotel on Sunday ""without any notification at all"". ""It is totally, 100% unacceptable,"" he said. ""This is a wrong-headed decision, the local police, the local council and I have been misled and I have no confidence at all that the Home Office, Serco or the minister himself have the first clue of what they are doing in relation to this asylum seeker relocation."" In response, Mr Jenrick said: ""I will be happy to make some inquiries and come back to [Mr Hollobone].""Tory MP for Clacton, Giles Watling, who asked the urgent question, said 24 hours was ""an inadequate timeframe"" to be given notice of a hotel being used to house asylum seekers.Another Tory MP, Henry Smith, called the Home Office ""dysfunctional"" and asked when it would ""get a grip and deal with the core problem that this government has caused"". He said a significant number of hotels in his Crawley constituency had been used to house migrants and this was starting to cause ""community tensions"". Mr Smith added that there was also an impact on businesses, with one hotel booked out until July 2024.Meanwhile, Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson said asylum accommodation was ""concentrated in poorer, cheaper areas"" as contractors sourcing housing were ""only interested in the bottom line"". Mr Jenrick agreed it did appear some parts of the country were ""bearing a disproportionate burden"" and said there needed to be ""fairer"" distribution of accommodation. He said the government had not caused the underlying issue and instead blamed the ""thousands of people who are crossing the Channel illegally"" for ""putting immense pressure on our asylum system"". But Labour's shadow home office minister Stephen Kinnock said problems with the immigration system were of the government's ""own making"". He said using less experienced asylum decision-makers on lower wages was leading to slower decisions and an increasing backlog. Earlier, Home Secretary Suella Braverman admitted the UK government had failed to control its borders and the Home Office needed to improve its efficiency. However, she said the blame for the problem lay with people smugglers. More than 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.This has contributed to overcrowding at the Manston processing centre, which at one point earlier this month was holding around 4,000 people - more than double its capacity.The centre has since been cleared of people, after ministers sought to move people to hotels or other accommodation.Braverman: We have failed to control our bordersTory MPs vow to continue naming asylum hotelsManston migrant processing centre clearedWhat's behind the Home Office migrant backlog?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Robert JenrickHome OfficeImmigrationKetteringRefugees and asylum seekersPhilip Hollobone","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63734127"

The bill passed its first parliamentary hurdle, despite 29 Tory MPs refusing to back it. However, the government is expected to face trickier battles when the bill returns to the Commons next year.Mr Cleverly said he would listen to ""good faith"" arguments from MPs.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives were ""unified"" in their commitment to deal with the problem posed by migration.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said disagreements over the Rwanda bill were part of an ""ongoing psychodrama"" in the Conservative Party. The government's plan would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda, where they would have their claims processed and potentially be resettled.Sunak sees off Tory revolt over Rwanda billCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Ministers hope this will deter people from trying to get to the UK by making the dangerous journey across the Channel in small boats.The policy was blocked by the Supreme Court last month over safety concerns, forcing the government to introduce new emergency legislation.The Safety of Rwanda bill has come under attack from different sides of the Conservative party. The right-wingers on the European Research Group have argued the bill in its current form is not robust enough, with leader of the group Mark Francois saying they had been told Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was ""prepared to entertain tightening the bill"".However, any attempt to change the language could anger other Conservatives who have concerns that could lead to the UK breaching its international obligations. Mr Cleverly said he would listen to his colleagues' concerns and any ""good faith arguments"" about the legislation.Ms Cooper told the BBC that Labour opposed the scheme because it comes with a ""huge cost"" and would only see a small number of people sent to Rwanda. Asked if Labour opposed the principle of the idea of ""offshoring"" - handling claims overseas - she said her party would ""look at whatever works"". Labour along with the Liberal Democrats and SNP voted against the bill on Tuesday night; however, no Conservative MP voted against the bill.There had been fears in government that there could be a Tory rebellion, and in a sign of nerves, Climate Minister Graham Stuart flew back from the COP28 climate conference in Dubai to vote.However, in the end the bill passed with a comfortable 44 majority - with 313 in favour and 270 opposed. Twenty-nine Conservative MPs chose to abstain from voting on the bill - including former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.Altogether 37 Tory MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining. The bill will return to the House of Commons in January, where MPs will be able to propose amendments. Before becoming law, the bill will also have to be approved by the House of Lords where it will meet stiff opposition from some peers.

It also said the MoJ should adopt a new ""resettlement framework"" to ensure local authorities, probation services and charities commit to ensuring no prisoner ""is released from prison without safe and settled accommodation to go to"".The government's rough sleeping strategy, which was published shortly before Mr Sunak became prime minister, recognised the need to ""ensure that those leaving a public institution - whether it's prison, hospital or care - don't find themselves out on the streets with no place to go"".Meanwhile, refugees who cannot find housing are ""literally being left to chance in the hope that charities will help them"" by the government's attempts to abolish the asylum backlog, the group said.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to ""abolish"" that asylum backlog by the end of 2023.Since then, the government has cut in the total number of asylum claims from 136,000 this time last year to 99,000 through a ""tenfold increase in the pace at which we complete the processing"", according to Home Secretary James Cleverly.The APPG proposes extending the time for people granted asylum to exit Home Office accommodation from 28 to 56 days.'Postcode lottery'The APPG letter, seen by the BBC, said ""this is all happening within the context of record levels of homelessness"".

She has been no stranger to controversy in her time in office. Mrs Braverman resigned from the same job while Liz Truss was prime minister before being brought back into government a week later by Rishi Sunak.Here are eight things she said that made headlines - and caused controversy.A quick guide to Suella BravermanWho is the former home secretary?4 October 2022""I would love to have a front page of the Telegraph with a plane taking off to Rwanda, that's my dream, it's my obsession.""This was said at a fringe event at last year's Conservative Party conference, shortly after she had been appointed as home secretary by Liz Truss. She was referring to the government's asylum plan, to take asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel to the UK on a one-way ticket to Rwanda where they could claim asylum instead.Mrs Braverman faced criticism from refugee groups and others for trivialising the plight of people in need. The most important point about the quote is not whether you agree with its tone, but that the new home secretary was making clear her single priority would be controlling migration. 18 October 2022""Tofu-eating wokerati""One of Suella Braverman's first tasks as home secretary was to pilot through Parliament a plan to restrict the right to protest in order to stop highly disruptive stunts by groups, including Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil - such as motorway occupations. She accused the opposition of being in league with eco-protesters because a previous version of the measures had failed to win enough support. ""I am afraid that it is the Labour Party, the Lib Dems, the coalition of chaos, the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati and, dare I say, the anti-growth coalition that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today.""19 October 2022""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility: I resign"" The very next day Mrs Braverman sensationally quit as home secretary, after confessing to a serious blunder. She had sent a confidential and sensitive government email to her own Gmail account and then forwarded it to her confidante and Tory backbencher, John Hayes. However, the real story here was the timing. The incident had happened some time earlier - and her resignation came as Liz Truss was on the precipice and her government in turmoil. In her resignation letter, Mrs Braverman accused the embattled PM of breaking key pledges. The next day, Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. Less than a week later, Mrs Braverman's serious ministerial error was forgiven by the new prime minister, Rishi Sunak - and she was back in the same job. 31 October 2022  ""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast."" There had been months of rising political tension over small boat crossings - and at the end of October 2022, a man firebombed the government's arrivals centre for the migrants in Dover's docks. Separately, independent inspectors warned conditions were ""wretched"" at a migrant reception camp. Mrs Braverman came out fighting in the Commons, but days later, she was confronted in her constituency by 83-year-old Holocaust survivor Joan Salter. ""When I hear you using words against refugees like 'swarms' and an 'invasion',"" she said, ""I am reminded of the language used to dehumanise and justify the murder of my family and millions of others.""PA Media7 March 2023""There are 100 million people around the world who could qualify for protection under our current laws. Let us be clear - they are coming here.""For the second time in two years, the government launched a new immigration plan.Parliament eventually voted to place a legal duty on the home secretary to not only detain anyone crossing the English Channel, but also remove them to another country, such as Rwanda. In the Commons, Mrs Braverman stuck to her guns and made the 100 million claim. The next day, she doubled-down, telling the Daily Mail there was ""likely billions"" eager to come to the UK. She returned to analysing migrant trends at the Conservative Party conference, last month, declaring: ""The wind of change that carried my own parents across the globe in the 20th Century was a mere gust compared with the hurricane that is coming.""Experts have disputed her projections, saying the UK receives far fewer asylum seekers than other countries, and that recent record numbers of arrivals of workers and students will likely level off. 26 September 2023 ""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate. It has failed.""The daughter of immigrants from Mauritius and Kenya, Mrs Braverman told an American think tank that migrants end up living ""parallel lives"" - a phrase first used 20 years ago in relation to complex riots in northern England.Opponents said she had given up fixing the UK's broken asylum system and was trying to set out her stall for the Tory leadership. 4 November 2023""We cannot allow our streets to be taken over by rows of tents occupied by people, many of them from abroad, living on the streets as a lifestyle choice.""That social media post came amid government backroom wrangling over what would make it into this year's King's Speech. Mrs Braverman reportedly wanted to impose fines on charities who give tents to rough sleepers.  Her push to get the police included triggered an internal row with colleagues. The idea was not included in the speech.30 October 2023""There's only one way to describe those marches: they are hate marches.""Speaking after a government emergency meeting over the crisis in Gaza, Mrs Braverman laid into the pro-Palestinian demonstrators amid rows over whether their chants amounted to antisemitic attacks. And it's the row that has ultimately led to her downfall. On 8 November, the Times newspaper published a column by the Mrs Braverman where she repeated the phrase - and also accused the police of bias, saying they were ""playing favourites"" with some demonstrations and using stronger tactics against some and not others.This triggered accusations of political interference in independent policing - an absolute red line that ministers cannot cross under British laws.Her comments were condemned by former police officers, MPs and Labour, who accused her of ""deliberately creating division"". Four days later - and following clashes between protesters, counter-protesters and police in London on Armistice Day - she was sacked.Who is Suella Braverman?A quick guide to Suella BravermanSuella Braverman","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67374951"

Giving a press conference after the legislation was approved by MPs, Mr Sunak said it was now up to the Lords to ""do the right thing"".He told the BBC the government was still aiming for deportation flights to take off by the spring. But he added that peers needed to pass the bill ""as quickly as possible"". The legislation, which seeks to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country, was passed by 320 to 276 votes in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Although in the end only 11 Conservative MPs voted against the legislation as a whole, Mr Sunak still suffered his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister when around 60 backed changes they said would toughen up the legislation. The rebels argue the bill will not work in its current form as they believe flights will still be blocked by legal challenges. The aim of the policy is to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, which Mr Sunak has made a key priority of his premiership. However, Labour says it an expensive ""gimmick"", which is unworkable and unlawful. Sunak rebuked by stats watchdog over asylum claimRwanda bill passes but poll gloom still haunts PMWill planes to Rwanda ever take off?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Before becoming law, the bill must be approved by the House of Lords, where it is expected to face strong opposition. The Lords are unlikely to vote it down completely but they can propose changes which would delay its progress. Crossbench peer Lord Carlile, a leading lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, described the bill as ""a step towards totalitarianism"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme many peers would see it as ""a step too far"" and an ""illegitimate interference by politics with the law"".Mr Sunak urged peers to pass the bill unamended to get flights up and running, describing this as ""an urgent national priority"". ""The treaty with Rwanda is signed and the legislation which deems Rwanda a safe country has been passed unamended in our elected chamber,"" he said. ""There is now only one question. Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected House? Or will they get on board and do the right thing?""Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the PM's comments were ""bizarre"". ""The House of Lords exists to scrutinise legislation,"" he said, adding that this function was ""very important in our democracy"".1:03Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan battle isn’t over yetQuestioned by journalists after the press conference over when flights carrying asylum seekers would leave for Rwanda, the prime minister did not give a concrete date. Asked if he could guarantee flights would take off before the next general election, which is expected this year, Mr Sunak said: ""I've been crystal clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible… and it's now up to the House of Lords.""However, in an interview with the BBC later, he said: ""We're working to the same timetable that we've always been working to... and that means spring but obviously the House of Lords needs to pass its legislation as quickly as possible.""Peers are due to begin debating the Rwanda bill before the end of this month, with the most crucial votes held in early March, according to senior House of Lords sources. After this, the legislation will enter ""ping pong"", where the Commons and Lords try to reconcile their versions of the bill. This is likely to involve the government trying to remove any changes inserted by the Lords. If all goes to plan the bill should pass around mid-March. Even after it becomes law, Mr Sunak's critics believe legal challenges could still delay or block deportation flights.Debate over the bill has exposed the deep divisions within the Conservative Party. On Tuesday two deputy party chairmen - Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith - as well as a ministerial aide, Jane Stevenson, quit their roles to rebel against the government and vote for changes to the bill. The BBC has been told a handful of Tory MPs have submitted letters calling for a vote of confidence in Mr Sunak. However, this is almost impossible to prove unless an MP chooses to publish their letter. It would take 15% of the parliamentary party - currently 53 MPs - to submit letters to trigger a no-confidence vote. After this a majority of Tory MPs would have to vote against Mr Sunak in a secret ballot for him to be removed as leader.

He said ""stronger protections"" were needed to end ""the merry-go-round of legal challenges which risk paralysing the scheme"". The government said the bill, unveiled earlier, made clear in UK law Rwanda was a safe country for asylum seekers.But it stops short of what some on the Tory right were demanding. In his resignation letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Jenrick said the prime minister had ""moved towards my position"" on the emergency legislation.""Nevertheless, I am unable to take the currently proposed legislation through the Commons as I do not believe it provides us with the best possible chance of success.""Mr Jenrick added that the bill was ""a triumph of hope over experience"".In response, the prime minister described Mr Jenrick's resignation as ""disappointing"" and ""based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation"". ""If we were to oust the courts entirely, we would collapse the entire scheme,"" Mr Sunak said. ""The Rwandan government have been clear that they would not accept the UK basing this scheme on legislation that could be considered in breach of our international law obligations.""Robert Jenrick's resignation letter in fullMood in Conservative Party bleak after Jenrick's resignationThe plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda aim to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats.But the scheme has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to the east African country from the UK so far.Mr Jenrick, who had supported Mr Sunak's leadership campaign, said the emergency legislation was the ""last opportunity"" to prove the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to stop small boat crossings. Losing a minister who was once a key ally is a blow for Mr Sunak, in a week when the government had been trying to get on the front foot on migration. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""It is a sign of the total chaos in the Tory party and the complete collapse of Rishi Sunak's leadership that even while he is sitting in the Commons for the announcement of his new Rwanda plan, his own immigration minister is resigning because he doesn't think it will work.""What's in the new Rwanda bill and why is it controversial?Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Senior figures are musing privately that they would not be surprised if Mr Sunak ended up facing a confidence vote from his own MPs. Although it may not come to that, it is a measure of the bleak mood among many Conservatives.1:51Suella Braverman tells her party it is ""now or never"" to act over illegal migration into the UKReports of Mr Jenrick's resignation first started swirling after the government published the draft bill. The legislation aims to address the concerns of the UK's Supreme Court, which last month ruled plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were unlawful.The bill - which must be approved by Parliament - orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act in an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court's existing judgement.It also orders the courts to ignore other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - that stand in the way of deportations to Rwanda.However, it does not go as far as some Tory MPs wanted.Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and her supporters had called for it to override the entire Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Refugee Convention, and all other international law.The bill allows ministers to ignore any emergency order from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to temporarily halt a flight to Rwanda while an individual case is still being considered.But it stops short of providing powers to dismiss the whole of the ECHR. It also allows migrants to legally challenge their removal to Rwanda on specific individual grounds, if they can prove that being put on a plane would leave them at real risk of serious harm.A source close to Mrs Braverman said the bill was ""fatally flawed"" and would be ""bogged down in the courts for months and months"".However, if the government had agreed to her demands this would have provoked a backlash from centrist Tories.The One Nation group, which is made up of more than 100 Tory MPs, had warned that overriding the ECHR was a ""red line"" for a number of Conservatives. The group cautiously welcomed ""the government's decision to continue to meet the UK's international commitments which uphold the rule of law"" but added that it would seek legal advice ""about concerns and the practicalities of the bill"". The draft legislation concedes that it may not be compatible with the ECHR. This means government lawyers have told ministers the measures could still be legally challenged.Who is Robert Jenrick?The former solicitor became a Conservative MP when he was elected in the 2014 by-election in the Nottinghamshire seat of Newark.He was promoted into the cabinet as housing secretary in 2019 by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Jenrick, a 41-year-old father-of-three, also briefly served as a junior health minister in Liz Truss's government, despite backing Mr Sunak for the Tory leadership.As immigration minister he consistently pushed for a harder line on legal and illegal immigration, expressing frustration at the high levels of both.He was also at the centre of several controversies, including a row over approving planning permission for Tory donor Richard Desmond.Mr Jenrick was also criticised for ordering a mural of Disney characters at a child asylum centre to be painted over.Sunak tells Rwanda policy critics they are wrong after minister quitsRwanda bill overrides some human rights lawBraverman: Tories face oblivion if Rwanda bill failsCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Robert JenrickUK immigrationImmigrationRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67640833"

The bill has now cleared its first hurdle in the upper chamber. Key votes on the legislation in the Lords are not expected until next month.Any changes made by peers are likely to be overturned by the Commons.The government is hoping to get the flights to Rwanda running by the spring.'Shoddy' billDuring the debate, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the bill was ""damaging"" to the UK's reputation, to ""national unity"" and to asylum seekers ""who are in need of protection"".This bill ""obscures the truth that all people, asylum seekers included, are of great value"" he said.The archbishop said he would not vote against the bill at second reading, but told peers the UK ""can do better"".Labour's former home secretary Lord David Blunkett called the bill ""shoddy and less than this country deserves"".Lord Blunkett argued the Rwanda Bill fails its main purpose because it ""punishes"" asylum seekers, not smuggling gangs.To stop smuggling boats, Lord Blunkett said Britain needs to ""get its act together"" by securing borders, processing claims and making new deals with the French.However, Conservative Lord Hannan, a former MEP, said the bill was ""imperfect"" but was part of a ""package of measures"" that would act as a deterrent, curbing the demand for illegal migration to the UK.Former minister and Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost expressed support for the bill, arguing that the government was ""right to do what is necessary to re-establish control"" over illegal immigration. ""We have no obligation to take in just anybody who shows up.""Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Ken Clarke said the bill would endanger the UK's constitution.Declaring Rwanda a safe country is ""trying to overturn"" the facts found by the Supreme Court, which ruled the country was unsafe for asylum seekers, he said. The government might as well rule ""all dogs are cats"", he added.Crossbench peer and leading lawyer Lord Carlile said there was ""plenty of evidence that Rwanda is not a safe country"" and the government was ""asking us to legislate a lie"". The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said he would only support the bill if concerns raised by peers about Rwanda's asylum procedures were resolved. Ahead of the debate, Downing Street insisted the Rwanda Bill was the ""right thing to do"".The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This bill is a key part of how we stop violent criminal gangs targeting vulnerable people that has led to too many deaths in the English Channel.""It is also the fair thing to do both for taxpayers and for those individuals seeking to come here through safe and legal routes who see their place jumped by those who can afford to make crossings on small boats.""Tory divisionsThe prime minister was able to pass the bill through the Commons after a threatened Conservative rebellion failed to materialise.Mr Sunak has argued deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to get to the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats, but Labour has labelled the plan an expensive ""gimmick"".Debate over the legislation has exposed on-going divisions among Conservatives - leading to two deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quitting their roles in order to vote for the rebel amendments.In the final round of voting in the Commons on 18 January, more than 60 Conservative MPs backed rebel amendments to allow the UK government to ignore parts of human rights law when sending people to Rwanda.Dozens of Tory MPs had suggested they would be willing to abstain or even vote against the entire bill without fundamental changes.However, in the event, just 11 MPs voted against it - including former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.The votes were a culmination of months of Conservative party infighting and coincided with a poll funded by an anonymous group called Conservative Britain Alliance - which projected Labour was on course for a 120-seat majority.Tory pollster Lord Hayward has called for the Electoral Commission to look into polls pushed by groups with no credible identifiable ""beneficial owner"".UK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68126734"

He added that people under threat of deportation would still be able to appeal on the grounds that Rwanda, even if generally safe, is not individually safe for them.""I think that a political choice has been made to bring forward a bill which doesn't do the job,"" he said.He had quit as immigration minister because he couldn't ask MPs to vote for a legislation he deemed ""a weak bill that won't work,"" he added.The government had already introduced two bills to deal with the issue of illegal migration, he said, adding: ""It's three strikes or you're out"".Although he conceded the Rwanda plan could eventually lead to some ""symbolic"" flights taking off, there would not be enough deportations to deter people from crossing the English Channel.The bill to revive the scheme has divided opinions among Conservative MPs, whose support Mr Sunak will need to ensure the bill passes its first parliamentary stage next week.PA MediaMinisters argue the threat of deportation to Rwanda will deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe prime minister has previously insisted his legislation will only allow legal challenges from those who can prove they are at ""real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm"".Speaking on the same programme, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove echoed this point, adding that only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals would still be allowed. The government's law had already been endorsed in a ""plethora of legal opinion,"" he said, and was a ""robust bill that is legally sound"".Some liberal Tories have argued it goes too far in trying to bypass the courts, and puts the UK at risk of breaching its international legal obligations towards refugees.But others on the right of the party say it does not go far enough, and will continue to be derailed by legal challenges.Mr Jenrick added that he, along with like-minded Conservative MPs, hoped to persuade ministers ""that there is a better way"" to design the new law, adding he wanted the bill to work and create a ""powerful deterrent"". Tory faction fight The different factions within the Tory party are taking legal advice on the legislation, and are expected to deliver their verdict on the bill before Tuesday's vote.On Sunday, a leading member of the European Research Group (ERG) - a group on the right of the party - said its own legal advice found the law was not fit for purpose.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Bill Cash said the current wording of the legislation was not ""sufficiently watertight"".At the vote on Tuesday, MPs will be asked to decide whether the bill should be blocked completely, or allowed to progress to its next stage in Parliament.Labour and opposition parties have already said they will try and vote it down, meaning the government needs to ensure enough Tory MPs vote for it to allow it to pass.Tory critics of the bill could decide to allow the bill to pass at this stage, possibly by abstaining, in the hope of securing concessions from the government as it goes through the Commons.Minimum salary hikeMr Jenrick also warned the Tories would face ""red hot fury"" from voters unless the party is able to do more to tackle both legal and illegal migration.The governmentunveiled measureslast week to reduce levels of legal migration, following a backlash within the party after official figures showed it reached a record 745,000 in 2022.Labour has also said it thinks legal migration is too high, blaming the current high levels on a lack of training and skills development for Britons.Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said the party agreed with a government decision to raise the £26,200 minimum salary to apply for a UK work visa.However she refused to say whether its proposed hike to £38,700 was the right level, adding her party would like official migration advisers to publish their evidence first.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Tory MPs under pressure to back Sunak Rwanda planRobert JenrickUK immigrationRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67674763"

Only two Conservative MPs - Simon Hoare and Tim Loughton - voted against the government to support the plan, along with opposition parties, but other Tories may have abstained. Speaking afterwards, former Justice Secretary Sir Robert Buckland said the letter to Boris Johnson had ""underlined the scale of support for reform from within our own party"".He added that a Home Office minister had agreed to meet him ""to find a mutually agreeable solution"", adding: ""[I] hope we can reach that solution before [the Lords] sends the amendment back to the Commons.""A number of other amendments to the bill, also proposed in the House of Lords, were voted down.But the legislation will now return to the Lords for peers to examine again.'Desperate' asylum seekers work illegally Anger over MP's 'work visas for refugees' commentCan Priti Patel's asylum plan work?

Those who are permitted to work are only allowed to get jobs on the shortage occupation list - published by the Home Office - until their claim is approved or rejected. Then, they either have free access to the job market, or are expected to leave the UK.Conservative peers - including Boris Johnson's brother, Lord Johnson - wanted to reduce the time limit of allowing asylum seekers to get jobs to six months. And after Tory Baroness Philippa Stroud put forward the proposal in the House of Lords, it was voted through and added onto the bill.The bill, with its amendment, returned to the Commons to be debated on Tuesday, with support from a wide-range of MPs within the party.'Contribution to make'Speaking in the debate, Sir Robert said he did not think it was a ""particularly controversial"" measure, just ""practical and right"". He said: ""As we confer the right to work on our friends from Ukraine who are arriving in our country, who are fleeing war and persecution, why not then do the same for others who are seeking asylum and fleeing persecution?""""I have long felt that the waste that we see with regard to, not just lives but also expenditure, when asylum seekers have to stay very often for years in a state of limbo before knowing their position, whether it is to be accepted or not, it is unnecessary. ""It is unnecessary because I think that people who are in this position have a contribution to make to our society."" His Tory colleague David Simmonds agreed, adding: ""As a Conservative politician, it frustrates me that taxpayers' money is being spent on people whose skills who could be put to good use in our economy."" However, neither MP voted to push forward to plan.

'Fix the system'Mr Pursglove offered to speak to MPs with concerns, but closing the debate, he said there was a ""clear distinction"" between those coming from Ukraine and able to work immediately, and those who have to wait.

The legislation is central to the prime minister's pledge to stop small boats crossing the English Channel.Under the bill, the home secretary has a legal duty to detain and remove anyone entering the UK illegally. In a late-night debate in the House of Lords, peers rejected attempts to reinsert time limits on child detention and modern slavery protections. The bill will now go for royal assent and become law.Chris Mason: Big moment on small boats but solution still far offHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?On Tuesday, the UN released an unusually critical statement, claiming the bill breaks the UK's obligations under international law.In a joint statement the UN human rights chief Volker Turk and the UN refugees head Filippo Grandi said the bill ""will have profound consequences for people in need of international protection"".""This new legislation significantly erodes the legal framework that has protected so many, exposing refugees to grave risks in breach of international law,"" Mr Grandi said.A Home Office spokesperson said the government took its international obligations seriously, and that nothing in the bill required the government to act incompatibly with international law.They added: ""Our Illegal Migration Bill is a key part of our work to deter and prevent people from making small boat crossings, as it will see people who make these dangerous, illegal and unnecessary  journeys detained and swiftly removed.""Legal uncertaintyAs it stands it is unclear what will happen to people coming to the UK on small boats in the coming months, according to BBC home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.The bill places a legal duty on the government to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another ""safe"" third country. But there are no similar return deals with any other countries, our correspondent said.And the Rwanda plan was ruled unlawful by the Court of Appeal last month, although ministers are challenging the judgement.On Tuesday, an accommodation barge arrived in Portland Port, Dorset, where it is due to eventually house 500 asylum seekers.The first asylum seekers are expected to board the Bibby Stockholm later this month, despite protests from locals. The prime minister's official spokesman said that the government wants to ""open more"" accommodation facilities for asylum seekers.Parliamentary ping-pongFor weeks, the government was locked in a battle over the final shape of the bill with the Lords, where a cross-party group of peers made repeated amendments.In the last few days, the bill passed between the House of Commons and House of Lords three times, in a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.Former Prime Minister Theresa May led a series of backbench rebellions in the Commons over plans to restrict access to the UK asylum system for victims of modern slavery.Under the bill the duty to remove anyone who comes to the UK illegally applies to victims of trafficking and slavery, accompanied children and unaccompanied children as soon as they turn 18.Ms May, who as home secretary introduced the Modern Slavery Act, said the bill ""will enable more slave drivers to operate and make money out of human misery"".The government argued that anyone identified as a potential victim of modern slavery would be returned home or to another ""safe country away from those who have trafficked them"".However, on Monday Mrs May did not vote for an exemption from the bill for suspected victims of slavery to allow them to access support and co-operate with criminal proceedings against traffickers.The legislation would also scrap existing legal caps on how long those entering the UK illegally can be held ahead of being deported. MPs and peers had attempted to reinsert the three day-limit on how long children can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult. But the plans were dropped after they were again rejected in the House of Commons.The government had already made concessions on the detention of unaccompanied children, who will be granted immigration bail after eight days, and on pregnant women, for whom the current limit of 72 hours detention will be retained. 0:42Watch: Braverman ""disappointed"" with Rwanda rulingThe end of the stand-off between peers and MPs paves the way for the bill to receive royal assent - when the King formally agrees to make the bill into an Act of Parliament, or law.During the Lords debate, Home Office minister Lord Murray of Blidworth said the number of small boat arrivals had ""overwhelmed"" the UK's asylum system and that accommodation was costing taxpayers £6m per day.""With over 45,000 people making dangerous Channel crossings last year this is simply no longer sustainable,"" he told peers, adding it was ""only right"" that the ""business model"" of human traffickers be broken. He urged the Lords to ""respect the will of the elected House and the British people by passing this bill"".Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called he new law ""a con which will only make the Tories asylum chaos worse"".""The asylum backlog is a record high, the number of people in hotels is still increasing, the Rwanda plan is unravelling and June boat crossings were higher than last year,"" she said.

Many have been led by far-right anti-immigrant groups such as Patriotic Alternative.Mr Anderson said protesters were ""just normal family people"" with concerns about the safety of their community.Speaking to the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Mr Anderson said: ""When you live in a community, you expect to be safe and you don't like sudden change.""That is how humans behave.""The Hope Not Hate campaign group accused Mr Anderson of ""parroting the misinformation used by the far-right to exploit hotels"".""This is precisely the same kind of myths that the far-right are peddling to whip up hate around hotels,"" a spokesperson said.

""And then they are saying things to young girls - and I know there have been a few attacks and some horrible incidents. ""So of course, people are going to be concerned.""Last week Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she understood people's ""frustrations"" about hotels housing asylum seekers and that this was ""causing understandable tensions within communities"". However, she told GB News ""violence is never acceptable"". Some Tories have expressed concern about far-right groups being involved in protests against the use of hotels for asylum seekers. Ahead of a protest in Skegness last week, local MP Matt Warman said the ""shameless use of people's concerns by far-right groups is to be deplored and stands in the way of our having a sensible conversation that will in the long term allow us to move beyond the use of these hotels"".

It said it was particularly worried about the possibility of children and pregnant women being detained.The government said the bill was ""within our international obligations"". How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillThe legislation, which will see its remaining stages debated in the Commons on Wednesday, would prevent anyone arriving in the UK illegally from claiming asylum. Instead they would be detained and removed, either to Rwanda or another ""safe country"". The power to detain and remove individuals also covers children and pregnant women, although the home secretary has said unaccompanied children would only be removed before they reach 18 under limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion. The government says the plans are central to achieving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop small boat crossings - one of his five key priorities. However, they have faced criticism from opposition parties and charities, who have argued the bill is unworkable and could breach international law. The EHRC said it was ""seriously concerned"" the legislation risked ""placing the UK in breach of its international legal obligations to protect human rights"". It said the bill ""undermines the core principle of the universality of human rights"" and risked breaching the international Refugee Convention, which the UK is signed up to, by restricting the right to asylum and penalising refugees. The commission also highlighted provisions removing protections for victims of trafficking and modern slavery as ""particularly worrying"".However, it welcomed the government's commitment to increase safe routes for those seeking asylum to come to the UK and recommended these were brought forward alongside the bill. The government promised to set out details of safe and legal routes and any proposals for new routes in an amendment to the bill, following calls from some Conservative MPs including Tim Loughton. Senior Tories including former Prime Minister Theresa May have raised concerns victims of modern slavery would be denied help under the bill, while others are worried about provisions allowing children to be detained. But the government has also been under pressure from Tory MPs on the right of the party to toughen up the bill and make it easier for the home secretary to ignore attempts by European judges to halt deportations of migrants from the UK. A government amendment to the bill published on Monday states that interim injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights do not affect the duty to remove individuals who arrive in the UK illegally. However, any amendments have to be approved by MPs and peers, some of whom have already raised concerns the proposal could breach international law. The bill is expected to face significant opposition in the House of Lords and legal challenge if it becomes law.Asked about criticism of the bill, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We cannot allow a system to continue which incentivises people to risk their lives and pay people smugglers to come here illegally.""UK migration bill set to be toughenedMay: Asylum plan won't solve illegal migrationHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillUK immigrationImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekers","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65376793"

Here's what you need to know.What time is the debate?Titled Our Next Prime Minister, the debate is being broadcast live from Stoke-on-Trent from 21:00 BST on BBC One and BBC Radio 5 Live. Sophie Raworth is the presenter.BBC political editor Chris Mason and economics editor Faisal Islam are offering their analysis on the programme, as well as some follow-up questions for the candidates. You can follow live coverage of the debate here.Who's in the audience?With the next prime minister being selected by Conservative Party members - a tiny slice of the electorate - the studio audience is made up of people who voted for the Tories in the previous general election, to see how the candidates come across to the party's supporters.A venue in Stoke-on-Trent Central was chosen because it was one of the constituencies won by the Conservatives for the first time in 2019.Retaining voters' support in places such as this will be a key test for Boris Johnson's successor.Multiple polls suggest Liz Truss has a strong lead among Conservative Party members. But Rishi Sunak's team argue the impression the candidates make on the wider electorate will still be crucial, because it will give clues as to who is more likely to win the next general election.What are the battleground issues?Much of the debate between the former cabinet colleagues so far has centred on the economy and tax, with Ms Truss saying she would cancel planned rises in National Insurance and corporation tax.Mr Sunak says he will cut taxes only after inflation is under control and has criticised Ms Truss's plans for cuts amid what he called the public services emergency in the NHS.Chris Mason: High stakes for Sunak and Truss before first debateWhat are the policies of final two hoping to be PM?Who chooses the next PM?Truss v Sunak: Who's winning the social media war?Both candidates have been promising tougher policies on migration and refugees as they compete for Tory members' votes. Mr Sunak has said he would introduce a cap on refugee numbers while Ms Truss has said she would increase the numbers of asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda.Ms Truss and Mr Sunak are also battling over who is perceived among Tories to be the continuity candidate who can build on Boris Johnson's Brexit-driven 2019 victory. The foreign secretary's supporters point out she remained loyal to Mr Johnson while Mr Sunak quit.

"3 October 2023","Tories imitating our policies, says Reform UK leader Richard Tice","Tories imitating our policies, says Reform UK leader Richard Tice3 October 2023ShareBrian WheelerPolitical reporterShareThe Reform UK leader says Labour would bankrupt Britain and the Conservatives have broken the country.Type ""Reform UK"" into a search engine and the first question that comes up is ""does Reform UK still exist?""The party that emerged from the ashes of the Brexit Party nearly three years ago - minus leader Nigel Farage - has had little mainstream media coverage.Yet someone is paying attention because Reform UK has consistently been in fourth place in the opinion polls, at around 6%, just ahead of the Green Party.Reform's leader Richard Tice grabbed some headlines at the start of this year when he declared his aim was to wipe out the Conservative Party.He sounds more even-handed in his disdain, when I ask if he still feels that way. ""The Tories have broken Britain and we believe Labour would bankrupt Britain - and the country has never been in such a terrible state,"" he says.Reform UK struggles in local elections  End foreign ownership of utilities, says Reform UKReform UK leader aims to wipe out Tories at pollsMr Tice claims that Rishi Sunak's recent policy shifts on net zero and Home Secretary Suella Braverman's criticisms of the UN's refugee convention - not to mention the government's apparent rethink on HS2 - are a direct result of pressure from Reform.""Imitation is a great form of flattery and what's happened is they are terrified of the number of people up and down the country who recognise that we actually stand up for the common sense solutions to the massive challenges that have resulted from Tory mismanagement.""Reform UK campaigns to scrap the 2050 target for achieving net zero carbon emissions - and Mr Tice says the UK should take the lead on reforming the ""outdated"" 1951 refugee convention.""We should say to the UN, as one of the most respected nations in the world, either we amend this or give a clear six month deadline or we are out,"" he says.He has also called for HS2 to be scrapped altogether, branding it a ""grotesque waste of taxpayers' cash"".But it is the net zero issue - he calls it ""net stupid"" - that he hopes will get his party noticed.""The vitriol that I get is far greater on net zero than it ever was on Brexit,"" he says.He has called on Rishi Sunak to hold a referendum net zero - a plea that has fallen on deaf ears.""Do you know why? Because he's terrified he'd lose it. And that a referendum on net zero, led by Nigel Farage and myself, would win.""Nigel Farage is the ghost at the table in any interview with Ricard Tice. The former UKIP leader's profile has rarely been higher after his battle with the banking industry.Mr Tice presents a programme on GB News (he was quick to condemn fellow presenter Laurence Fox's recent comments) which he says gets him recognised by voters.But he is hardly a household name. Will Mr Farage come out of retirement one final time to lend his profile to the party he founded?""Nigel and I are great friends, we speak to each other frequently, every week, He is doing a great job at GB News.""He has said he wouldn't want to stand again under first-past-the post but any help that he is able to give us, if we move towards PR, fantastic.""Richard Tice seems convinced that the UK will soon ditch first-past-the-post elections in favour of some form of proportional representation.Without such a change, he concedes that smaller parties like his will always struggle to get MPs elected to Westminster.Reform has so far been unable to convert its polling figures into electoral success, performing poorly in May's local elections.But Mr Tice emphatically rules out trying to use Reform's influence in other ways, such as by striking a deal with Conservatives that support its agenda, as Nigel Farage did in 2019 with the Brexit Party.Mr Farage was cheered by Tory MPs at a gala dinner in Manchester on Sunday, not far from the Tory conference, as he was praised for helping Boris Johnson win the 2019 general election by not contesting more than 300 seats.Asked about the prospect of a similar deal next year, Mr Tice says: ""We are standing 630 candidates in the whole of England, Scotland and Wales. Every single seat. I've already got over 400 lined up and there's a few more hundred going through the process. We are standing everywhere.""And anybody who thinks we are standing down and doing deals with anybody - they can forget it.""Reform is holding its party conference in London at the weekend. It will be a modest affair compared with the Tory get-together in Manchester, with 1,100 attendees, but its leader is keen to point out that at £12.50 a ticket is ""much better value"" than the Tory conference.He insists Reform is ""neither to the left or the right"", although he attacks the party's bigger rivals from the right, branding Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt ""consocialists"" who he says are no different to the ""socialist Labour Party"". He also expresses some sympathy for Liz Truss's ""tax cutting, high-growth agenda"", arguing that the short-lived Tory PM's mistake was not to link it to a plan to ""cut wasteful government spending in order to pay for it"".But his strategy is to attack what he sees as the mainstream political consensus, in the hope of striking a chord with voters - or ex-voters - who have had enough of conventional politicians.""We've got a country that is broken after years and years of promises and manifestos by both main parties and they have let everybody down and it's time for change, it's time for something different.

This could threaten Downing Street's ambition of getting the first flights to the east African country off the ground before June. What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda saga won't be over even when law is passedUK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum dealThe proposed law aims to ensure the UK can deport asylum seekers to Rwanda by declaring it to be a safe place, after the Supreme Court ruled last year it could lead to human rights breaches.Earlier this month, peers added changes to the bill to make it easier for judges to challenge this, and ensure the treaty underpinning deportations is ""fully implemented"" before flights take off.These were rejected in a series of votes on Monday evening, with government majorities ranging from 57 to 78.The bill will now return to the Lords on Wednesday in a process known as ""ping pong,"" where MPs and peers will try and agree the final wording, as the bill is batted between the two Parliamentary chambers.Labour has suggested its peers will not seek to block the bill's passage into law completely. However, the party will order them to try again to reinsert amendments designed to prevent flights taking off until the UK has more assurances that Rwanda is a safe country.If they fail, the bill could become law by the end of this week. But if they succeed, the bill would have to return to the Commons once again.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson urged peers to ""work with the government"" at the votes on Wednesday to help ""end the business of people smuggling"".'Frustrate and delay'Another vote would probably have to wait until MPs return from their Easter break on April 15, potentially delaying any flights by several weeks, unless the government clears the Commons schedule to allow votes next week.Labour says each deportation will cost as much as sending six people to space.Michael Tomlinson, Home Office minister, told the Commons on Monday that the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill was ""an essential element"" of protecting the UK's borders.He said that the bill did not conflict with the government's international obligations.Mr Tomlinson also criticised ""systematic legal challenges"" that he said continued to ""frustrate and delay"" removals.ReutersLegal challenges meant the first Rwanda flight was cancelled shortly before take-off in June 2022During the votes on Monday, Labour's Stephen Kinnock supported all the Lords amendments to the bill and said peers were fulfilling their ""patriotic duty"" by scrutinising the draft laws.The shadow Home Office minister said the government must have ""due regard"" for the Supreme Court ruling and claimed Conservative MPs were pushing through ""absurd legislation"" that is ""frankly turning our institutions into a laughing stock"".Labour backbencher Neil Coyle asked whether Mr Tomlinson was aware of the National Audit Office findings showing that the scheme could cost taxpayers nearly £2m for each of the first 300 asylum seekers sent to Rwanda.""Is the minister aware that Virgin Galactic can send six people into space for less than this government wants to spend sending one person to Rwanda?"" he said.""Is it not time to rethink this absurd policy and extortionate cost?""A Virgin Galactic flight to the edge of space for six people was costed at £2.14m last summer.Tory backbencher Richard Graham replied that critics of the cost ""entirely miss the point"" that it would act as a ""huge disincentive"" to those wishing to enter the UK without genuine reason.However Robert Buckland, a former justice secretary, was one of a few Conservative rebels to support some of the Lords' amendments, saying he was concerned about ""creating legal friction"" over whether Rwanda was and continued to be a safe destination.Sir Robert was also keen to stress his support for an amendment exempting those who had helped the UK's armed forces, such as Afghan translators, from deportation to Rwanda. He said: ""I would expect the government to be very sensible and sensitive to the position of Afghan refugees and future refugees and not put them into this scheme, it does seem to me to lose nothing by adding this particular insertion.""£63,000 more to remove a migrant than keep in UKPeers continue scrutiny of Rwanda billLords inflict more defeats on Rwanda billRwanda plan flawed at core says cross-party reportRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68599308"

But while it had previously been reported this included a penalty, it had not been confirmed. The BBC understands the dispute was resolved between July and September last year, and that the total amount paid is in the region of about £5m, as previously reported.'Get it all out now' over tax affairs, Zahawi urgedChris Mason: Trio of incidents pose questions for SunakPressure has been growing on Mr Zahawi to give more details about his finances after reports emerged this week he had agreed to pay millions of pounds to HMRC to settle his tax affairs.The Guardian had previously reported that Mr Zahawi paid back tax he had owed, as well as a 30% penalty, with the total settlement amounting to £4.8m.  The tax was related to a shareholding in YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in 2000 before he became an MP.Mr Zahawi has not confirmed how much his penalty amounted to, nor the total value of the final settlement with HM Revenue & Customs.Labour said there were questions that still needed answering - and called on him to publish all his correspondence with HMRC ""so we can get the full picture"". Labour also said there are questions over the timing.Although the BBC has been told the issue with HMRC was resolved while Mr Zahawi was chancellor - and the minister ultimately responsible for HMRC - it is still not clear when he originally became aware of it.His allies claim he told the government's Propriety and Ethics Team - which is in charge of ensuring ethics across government departments - about it before his appointment as chancellor.And after having become chancellor, Mr Zahawi did not seek to challenge HMRC's demands, but instructed his accountants to pay all of what they said was due, the BBC has been told.Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith urged Mr Zahawi on Sunday to release ""the absolute facts"", adding he did not believe he was ""deceitful"". Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said it was for Mr Zahawi to decide ""how much detail to put in the public domain"".Later on Sunday, Conservative MP Tim Loughton told the BBC's Westminster Hour it was fair to let Mr Zahawi put his side of the case but he should have given a fuller account earlier on. ""The more transparency, as early as possible, might have avoided all this speculation.""If there's more to it then he will absolutely have to stand up and take the consequences and the prime minister, I'm sure, will take the appropriate action.""1:23Watch: Cleverly defends Zahawi over tax avoidance claimsThe BBC was previously told on Saturday that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was satisfied with Mr Zahawi's account and has confidence in him as chairman of the Conservative Party.A former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s, Mr Zahawi went on to co-found the successful online polling company YouGov. He is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, after being elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in 2010. He gained public recognition for his role as vaccines minister during the pandemic and later served as education secretary. Between July and September 2022, he served briefly as chancellor under Boris Johnson, after the resignation of Mr Sunak. When Liz Truss took over as prime minister, he was made chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, minister for equalities and minister for intergovernmental relations. In October Mr Sunak appointed him Conservative Party chairman and minister without portfolio, attending cabinet as part of his role.

Ms Dodds used Parliamentary privilege, the rule which exempts MPs from libel law, to raise the allegations about Sir Ehud.Why are party donations often so controversial?Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them?Surge in Tory donations before polling day A spokesman for Sir Ehud said: ""The New York Times' allegations are a fabrication and Ms Dodds has unfortunately been sucked in by the paper's outrageous distortion. ""The facts are that Mr Kopytov, Sir Ehud's father-in-law, is a Ukrainian victim and is no Putin 'ally'. He is currently a refugee in the Czech Republic, having lost his job as a senior civil servant when the Russians annexed Crimea in 2014 and more recently he has had his Crimean assets put on the Russian 'nationalising' list. ""Mr Kopytov has not made a donation to the Conservative Party, whether through Sir Ehud or by any other means. It's completely untrue. ""The whole agenda-driven story is deeply offensive to Sir Ehud and his family, particularly given the unjustified war in Ukraine.""Last year, Barclays Bank filed a suspicious activity report with the National Crime Agency over Sir Ehud's 2018 donation.Banks are required by law to alert the NCA in this way when they suspect criminality.'Gift'Sir Ehud's lawyers say SARs are ""by no means infrequent"" and not a ""demonstration of wrongdoing"". In 2020, UK banks issued 432,316 SARs, according to the NCA's financial crime unit's annual report.The SAR issued in relation to the donation ""was filed 16 months ago, in relation to transactions that took place four years ago, and our client has not received any enquiries or notification of investigation by any relevant authority,"" Sir Ehud's lawyers said.It is against the law for political parties to accept money from individuals who are not on the UK electoral register.Sir Ehud's lawyers said Mr Kopytov made a cash gift to his daughter, Sir Ehud's wife, in January 2018 and the money was used to repay a loan made to Sir Ehud by his family's trust.A few weeks later Sir Ehud took out a loan from the family trust and used some of that to make a donation to the Conservative Party, according to his lawyers.Sir Ehud ""categorically rejects any suggestion that Mr Kopytov's gift to his daughter was intended as, or for the purpose of, making a political donation to the Conservative Party,"" the lawyers said.Further questionsIn a point of order in the House of Commons, Ms Dodds said the Conservative Party had ""genuine questions to answer"" about the donation, and she raised ""additional serious questions"" about the former Tory treasurer.""Did Sir Ehud host a reception with the Russian ambassador to the UK, following the annexation of Crimea? ""Are assets apparently owned by Mr Kopytov like, for example, a Mercedes Benz car, used by individuals involved in the Russian state? ""Did the bank transfer at issue in the New York Times article originate from a Russian bank? Were sanctioned entities involved? ""Exactly what current and former links do the Sheleg/Kopytov family hold with key actors in the Russian state? And finally, has electoral law been broken and relatedly has our national security been compromised?""  Ms Dodds said she had written to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden to demand answers - and asked what ""recourse"" she had if he declined to respond.Deputy Speaker Rosie Winterton told Ms Dodds it was a ""party matter"" and not something the Commons authorities could intervene in.'Wasting time'The Conservative Party said it ""only accepts donations from permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UK's electoral roll or UK registered companies"". ""Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them and comply fully with the law.""A Conservative Party source accused Ms Dodds of ""wasting Parliament's time with party political games"".In response to last week's New York Times story, the Electoral Commission said they were not investigating Sir Ehud and were ""not aware of any alerts relating to his financial transactions"".The watchdog said: ""If someone makes a donation on behalf of someone else, they are required to inform the party and provide the actual donor's details. ""Where there is evidence that a donation from an impermissible source has been accepted, we will consider it in line with our enforcement policy, and consider what action, if any, is appropriate.""From 2019 to 2021, Sir Ehud acted as the Conservative Party's treasurer - a role which involves raising money for the party. Between 2017 and 2020, the British-Israeli art gallery director donated £3.8m to the Conservatives.Sir Ehud - who was awarded a knighthood by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2019 - was the second biggest donor to the Conservative Party in the final two days before the 2019 general election.Why are party donations often so controversial?Who funds the Tory party and what's in it for them?Surge in Tory donations before polling dayConservative PartyOliver DowdenAnneliese Dodds","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61425441"

It comes after reports that former Tory Party chairman Sir Jake Berry wrote to police to make them aware of the claims after leaving the post last year.Labour and the Lib Dems have called for an investigation by the party into how it handled the accusations. Sir Jake told police a failure of some individuals to act allowed the alleged perpetrator to ""continue to offend"", the Mail on Sunday reported. Mr Sunak said the Conservative Party had ""robust independent complaint procedures in place"". During a visit to Bacton Gas Terminal in Norfolk, the prime minister was asked whether the rape allegations had been covered up and whether he was investigating the issue. He told broadcasters: ""These are very serious, anonymous allegations.""It may be that they allude to something that is already the subject of a live police investigation, so I hope you understand it wouldn't be right for me to comment on that further specifically.""More broadly the Conservative Party has robust independent complaint procedures in place, but I would say to anybody who has information or evidence about any criminal acts to of course talk to the police, that's the right course of action."" No cover-up of MP rape allegations, says deputy PMOn Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden, who was previously party chairman between September 2021 and June 2022, denied the party had covered up allegations. However, he said he could not comment on the specific case as he did not know the identity of the unnamed MP. Sir Jake, the MP for Rossendale and Darwen, was chairman of the Tory Party during Liz Truss's 49-day premiership last year.According to the Mail on Sunday, he became aware of a series of allegations against an MP - referred to as X - when he was appointed to the role in September 2022.The newspaper said that after leaving the post the following month, he wrote to police with former Chief Whip Wendy Morton to express his concerns about how the party had handled the claims.According to extracts of the letter published by the newspaper, he said the matter had been going on for more than two years, adding: ""The failure of others to act has enabled X to continue to offend.""A published extract reads: ""There may have been five victims of X - who have been subject to a range of offences including multiple rapes.""It also claims one unnamed individual was receiving ongoing support at the expense of the Conservative Party.Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said the case was ""horrific"". She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour political parties needed transparent processes in place for when individuals made complaints, with alleged victims supported to go to the police. ""My sense is one of horror and despair that still we haven't got in place a mechanism that will support victims, that will make sure that individuals who are accused of horrific acts are not still free to wonder around Parliament, free to meet with their constituents in constituency surgeries,"" she said. Labour Party chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said the allegations were ""deeply concerning"" and needed to be ""thoroughly investigated by the Conservative Party"".

You need to rule and govern through the structures, through Whitehall, through the cabinet, through the National Security Council.""That is not the way with Boris and many of us thought he would govern in the way he did when he was Mayor of London, through being chairman of the board, running a very good team; that is not what has happened here.""What he needs to do is govern through these structures I've described, and make sure he has got competent people out in the departments delivering on the agenda of the British people."" Analysis, Elizabeth Glinka, BBC Midlands Political EditorWhen you consider that the Conservative association in Sutton Coldfield voted unanimously just two weeks ago in a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson, then perhaps it is not so surprising that the MP has made this intervention.Tory MPs do tend to listen to what their Conservative associations say to them. Nevertheless, this is an important intervention by a senior backbencher, not just an ex-minister but also a former whip.There is still substantial support on the Conservative backbenches for the prime minister. Among those speaking were Midlands MPs Suzanne Webb (Stourbridge) and Bill Cash (Stone).Mr Johnson apologised in the House of Commons and said there would be changes at Number 10. Nevertheless, there were others calling for the full Sue Gray report to be published.Mr Mitchell is from a line of Conservative party members, with his father Sir David Mitchell serving as a junior minister during Margaret Thatcher's government.Earlier this month Mr Mitchell attended a meeting held by his constituency to withdraw its support from Boris Johnson, where he refrained from voting.Other West Midlands MPs have shown support for the PM, including Conservative Birmingham Northfield MP Gary Sambrook who said: ""He's made promises on how he wants to change how he does things, how he wants to deliver for my constituents and the UK and I support him in doing that."" Stuart Anderson, Conservative MP for Wolverhampton South West, said he welcomed Mr Johnson's apology and called on colleagues to unite. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

None.That in itself has provoked another round of all of the above and brings us to where we are now: ministers having another go at trying to make it work while plenty on their own Conservative benches fear it is doomed to fail just like the previous attempts.Right now, all this boils down to one big question: how many of those 60 Conservative MPs willing to back a proposed change to the Rwanda plan are actually willing to reject the whole thing outright in a crucial vote expected on Wednesday night?If half of them were willing to do so, the plan - and Mr Sunak - would be in deep, deep trouble.So far, only a handful have said publicly they are prepared to vote the plan down.But if ministers clock that number is ratcheting up, what do they do then? Try to find an accommodation with the rebels, but in so doing risk irritating those on the opposing wing of the party? It's not easy.The persuading, the arm-twisting, the cranking up of the stakes is only just beginning as the whips try to squeeze the number willing to nuke the bill entirely as low as they can.Up to now, sources in government have given off a quiet confidence there aren't the numbers to finish the plan off entirely.But they wouldn't be human if they weren't wobbling a little after what has just happened.Tory deputy chairs resign to rebel over Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68001724"

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised he will take tougher measures to ""smash"" the people-smuggling gangs responsible. How many people cross the Channel in small boats?As at 2 September, 21,403 people had crossed the Channel in 2024. That is more than in the same period in the previous year, but fewer than in 2022. In 2023 as a whole, 29,437 people came to the UK in small boats.The 2022 total of 45,755 was the highest since figures were first collected in 2018. Since 2018, more than 135,000 people have come to the UK by this route. How many people die crossing the Channel?At least 186 migrants died attempting to cross the English Channel between 2018 and September 2024, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which is part of the UN, estimates.Many of these deaths occurred in the Channel during a crossing, including 80 people known to have drowned.But the IOM figures also include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or medical issues.So far this year, 39 people have lost their lives, the highest figure for any year since 2021, when 40 deaths were recorded, the IOM says.In November 2021, at least 27 migrants died after a dinghy sank, the highest recorded number of deaths from a single incident. BBC sees people struggling on migrant boat before five diedDeath in the Channel - what led a boy to make fatal journey?Twelve die after migrant boat sinks in ChannelWho is crossing the Channel in small boats?The latest official statistics show that in the year to June 2024, Afghans were the top nationality crossing the Channel, making up just under a fifth of all small boat arrivals. Iranians (13%) were the second largest group, followed by arrivals from Vietnam and Turkey, both on 10%.About 83% of small boat arrivals in the 12 months to June 2024 were male and - where age was recorded - more than 40% were between 25 and 39 years old. France sees Channel migrant deaths as a problem of Britain's makingHow many people seek asylum in the UK?Just over 97,000 people claimed asylum in the year to the end of June 2024, according to the most recent figures.The number of annual applications for asylum - including dependants - peaked at about 103,000 in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq.Claims then fell sharply, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. However, numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria.In 2022, the number of applications reached almost 100,000 again.How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Starmer confirms Rwanda deportation plan 'dead'Where do UK asylum seekers come from?In the year to June 2024, the largest overall number of UK asylum seekers came from Afghanistan - 9,342.Other big countries for applications were Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh.In 2022, Albanians were the top nationality with more than 17,300 people (including dependants) claiming asylum. Three-quarters arrived on small boats.Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in these figures.As at 26 August 2024, 262,700 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees who have come through legal routes set up by the UK government.There are separate arrangements for a few other specific groups to come to the UK, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens.How many asylum cases are waiting to be processed?Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered.At the end of June 2024 there were 85,839 cases relating to 118,882 people awaiting an initial decision.Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023, but 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December.The latest official figures showed that on 14 April 2024, 2,377 of those applications were still waiting for an initial decision.Sunak rebuked by stats watchdog over asylum claimGovernment's asylum figures show uncleared backlog How many asylum seekers does the UK send back? The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter.In the year to the end of June 2024, 7,190 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country. This is up 48% from the previous year (4,873), mainly because of a rise in Albanian returns. In the same year, 2,336 people who arrived in small boats were returned. Between 2018 and June 2024, 3,788 people who came to the UK in small boats were returned, which is 3% of all small boat arrivals in that period.In December 2023, the Home Office revealed that only 408 non-Albanians who had come to the UK on small boats had been returned to their home countries since 2020.How do UK small boats arrivals compare with those to Europe?In 2023, there were 263,048 sea arrivals in Europe, with Italy receiving 60% of those (157,314). Spain received 57,071 people and Greece 41,561.   As of 27 August 2024,almost 110,000 people had arrived into Europe via the sea since the start of the year.  The number of arrivals in Europe peaked in 2015, when more than a million people crossed its borders - the majority fleeing the Syria conflict. How many people apply for asylum across Europe?In 2023, the UK had the fifth highest number of people claiming asylum in Europe.With 329,035 applicants, Germany received more than a quarter of all first-time asylum applicants within the EU.Spain had the second highest number (160,460) followed by France (145,095) and Italy (130,565). In 2023, the UK government made initial decisions on 93,303 asylum applications - including people attached to them such as children or other dependents - and granted more than two thirds of them (67%). In the same period, Germany made 217,430 asylum decisions, and granted 62%.

"16 November 2023","Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawful","Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawful16 November 2023ShareDominic Casciani and Sean SeddonBBC NewsShare0:46Lord Reed concludes: ""The home secretary's appeal is therefore dismissed.""The government's Rwanda asylum policy, which it says is needed to tackle small boats, is in disarray, after the UK's highest court ruled it is unlawful.The Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeal ruling, which said the policy leaves people sent to Rwanda open to human rights breaches.It means the policy cannot be implemented in its current form.Rishi Sunak said the government would work on a new treaty with Rwanda and said he was prepared to change UK laws.The controversial plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda and ban them from returning to the UK has been subject to legal challenges since it was first announced by Boris Johnson in April 2022.The government has already spent £140m on the scheme but flights were prevented from taking off in June last year after the Court of Appeal ruled the approach was unlawful due to a lack of human rights safeguards.Now that the UK's most senior court has agreed, the policy's chances of being realised without major revisions are effectively ended.But Mr Sunak told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions that he was ready to finalise a formal treaty with Rwanda and would be ""prepared to revisit our domestic legal frameworks"" in a bid to revive the plan.A treaty - which Downing Street has said it will publish in the ""coming days"" - would upgrade the agreement between the UK and Rwanda from its current status as a ""memorandum of understanding"", which the government believes would put the arrangement on a stronger legal footing.The new text would provide the necessary reassurances the Supreme Court has asked for, the prime minister's official spokesman said.LIVE: Reaction to Supreme Court Rwanda rulingChris Mason: Ruling leaves Rwanda policy in tattersHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?What was the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Ministers have been forced to reconsider their flagship immigration policy after 10 claimants argued that ministers had ignored clear evidence that Rwanda's asylum system was unfair and arbitrary. The legal case against the policy hinges on the principle of ""non-refoulement"" - that a person seeking asylum should not be returned to their country of origin if doing so would put them at risk of harm - which is established under both UK and international human rights law.In a unanimous decision, the court's five justices agreed with the Court of Appeal that there had not been a proper assessment of whether Rwanda was safe. The judgement does not ban sending migrants to another country, but it leaves the Rwanda scheme in tatters - and it is not clear which other nations are prepared to do a similar deal with the UK. The Supreme Court justices said there were ""substantial grounds"" to believe people deported to Rwanda could then be sent, by the Rwandan government, to places where they would be unsafe. It said the Rwandan government had entered into the agreement in ""good faith"" but the evidence cast doubt on its ""practical ability to fulfil its assurances, at least in the short term"", to fix ""deficiencies"" in its asylum system and see through ""the scale of the changes in procedure, understanding and culture which are required"". A spokesman for the Rwandan government said the policy's legality was ""ultimately a decision for the UK's judicial system"", but added ""we do take issue with the ruling that Rwanda is not a safe third country"".ReutersA flight was due to take off for Rwanda in June 2022 but was grounded after legal challengesIt leaves Mr Sunak - who has made tackling illegal immigration a central focus of his government - looking for a way to salvage the policy.In a statement issued after the ruling, the prime minister said the government had been ""planning for all eventualities and we remain completely committed to stopping the boats"".He continued: ""Crucially, the Supreme Court - like the Court of Appeal and the High Court before it - has confirmed that the principle of sending illegal migrants to a safe third country for processing is lawful. This confirms the government's clear view from the outset.""Mr Sunak is expected to hold a televised press conference in Downing Street at 16:45 GMT on Wednesday. The Supreme Court decision comes amid the political fallout from the sacking of Suella Braverman on Monday, who, as home secretary had championed the Rwanda policy.Following the ruling, Mrs Braverman called on Mr Sunak to introduce ""emergency legislation"" which would block routes of legal challenge, including the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) - which some on the Tory right have called for the UK to withdraw from.Newly appointed Home Secretary James Cleverly told the Commons on Wednesday the government had been ""working on a plan to provide the certainty that the court demands"" for ""the last few months"".He said upgrading the agreement to a treaty ""will make it absolutely clear to our courts and to Strasbourg that the risks laid out by the court today have been responded to, will be consistent with international law"".PA MediaThe ruling comes less than 24 hours after Suella Braverman accused the prime minister of failing to plan for an alternative to the Rwanda policyLee Anderson MP, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, urged the government to ignore the Supreme Court and ""put planes in the air"" anyway.Natalie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover, the landing point for many of the small boats, said the Rwanda policy is ""at an end"" and ""we now need to move forward"".""With winter coming the timing of this decision couldn't be worse. Be in no doubt, this will embolden the people smugglers and put more lives at risk,"" she continued.But charity Asylum Aid said the government must ""abandon the idea of forcibly removing people seeking asylum to third countries"", describing the policy as ""cruel and ineffective"".More than 100,000 people have arrived in the UK via illegal crossings since 2018, though the number appears to be falling this year.In 2022, 45,000 people reached the UK in small boats. The total is on course to be lower for 2023, with the total for the year so far below 28,000 as of November 12.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Chris Mason: Rwanda migrants policy in tattersHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?If not Rwanda, then what happens next?Refugees and asylum seekersUK Supreme CourtRishi SunakRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67423745"
"2 May 2024","Rwanda: Civil servants mount court challenge over new law","Rwanda: Civil servants mount court challenge over new law2 May 2024ShareDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentShareEPAThe Rwanda scheme was designed as a deterrent to small boat crossingsThe union for senior civil servants is launching an unprecedented legal challenge to ministers' Rwanda plan. The FDA said it was intervening because it feared the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda could force officials to break the law.  Under a new law, ministers can ignore the European Court of Human Rights and direct officials to organise flights. The union wants the High Court to rule on whether that element would put civil servants in a difficult legal position. The FDA fears civil servants could be stuck between judges and ministers and that a direction to breach international law, would put them in conflict with the Civil Service Code. The government said advice from Darren Tierney, its head of propriety and ethics, says the code would not be breached. In a letter published on the government's website, Mr Tierney wrote: ""In implementing the decision, civil servants would be operating in accordance with the Civil Service Code, including the obligation not to frustrate the implementation of policies once decisions are taken.""They would be operating in compliance with the law, which is the law enacted by Parliament under which the minister's specifically recognised and confirmed discretion would be exercised."" What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Why a plane to Rwanda won’t be taking off anytime soonFailed asylum seeker given £3,000 to go to RwandaThe Rwanda plan is the key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop migrants from crossing the English Channel in dangerous dinghies. The Safety of Rwanda legislation overrules last November's Supreme Court decision which said that the country was not a safe place to send genuine refugees because they could be returned from there to their home countries and subjected to torture and abuse.It also limits what kind of legal challenges they can present to the courts and, crucially, says ministers could choose to ignore a temporary order from the European Court of Human Rights to halt flights while a case is still being considered. In practice, that would see ministers ordering key civil service leaders to prepare and send off flights, even if judges have said the case has not been settled. The First Division Association (FDA), which represents those Whitehall leaders, said that measure means members fear they could be ordered to break both international law and the Civil Service Code, their legally-underpinned rule book.Dave Penman, the FDA's general secretary, said its members were not taking a political view on whether the Rwanda plan was right or wrong - but they needed certainty about whether the measure places them in a conflict between ministers and the law.""This [measure] is not an accident or down to poor drafting,"" he said.""It's a political choice from the government, made not for the good of the country but to avoid upsetting either of the warring factions within its own party.""""It's also irresponsible. Civil servants know that they have to support the government of the day and implement policy, regardless of their political beliefs, but they also know they have a legal obligation to adhere to the Civil Service Code. ""Faced with a government that is prepared to act in this cowardly, reckless way, it is left to the FDA to defend our members and the integrity of the civil service.""'Nationwide operations'The FDA will now ask the High Court to prioritise its case - but there is no guarantee that judges will do so. But if the case goes to a full hearing - even though no departure dates have yet been set - it could temporarily paralyse the policy. In a worst case scenario, judges could rule that the government has created an unlawful conflict that then prevents top civil servants from implementing the plan. Earlier on Wednesday, the Home Office confirmed ""a series of nationwide operations"" was under way to detain people across the country ahead of their removal to Rwanda. Photographs and a video were released of immigration enforcement officers detaining several migrants at different residences, before they were led away in handcuffs and put into secure vehicles.Each person being considered for forcible removal to Rwanda must be given at least seven days' written notice of that intention and they have the right to launch a legal challenge.The government had previously said it was aiming for flights to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks. Labour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins the next election. However, asked several times whether the party would release those detained as part of the policy, Labour's deputy nation campaign coordinator Ellie Reeves would not say.""We want to get people back to their own countries if their claims have failed which is why we would set up those return agreements and also recruit a thousand case workers,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. Labour have said they would allow those who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum, something current arrivals are barred from doing.The party added that no flights to Rwanda carrying asylum seekers would be scheduled by a Labour government.But this does mean any already scheduled before the election, for departure afterwards, could still leave.The precise nature of how Labour plan to handle the small boats issue is now the subject of considerable scrutiny, with the general election drawing closer and the legal framework it would inherit if it wins much clearer than it was.'Great anxiety'On Monday it emerged that most of the asylum seekers initially earmarked for deportation to Rwanda could not be immediately located. Home Office documents show 5,700 asylum seekers have been identified in the initial cohort to be sent to Rwanda, but only ""2,143 continue to report to the Home Office and can be located for detention"".No 10 said it was ""not accurate"" to say the Home Office was unable to locate the others, but a government source admitted it was possible some could abscond before they were detained.The Home Office said it had increased detention capacity to more than 2,200 spaces and had 500 highly-trained escorts ready. The department said commercial charters had also been booked and an airport had been put on standby. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""The government's move to detain people is causing fear, distress and great anxiety amongst men, women and children who have fled war and persecution to reach safety in the UK.""He said the government should focus on processing asylum claims ""efficiently and fairly"", rather than ""headline-grabbing schemes that will waste time and resources"".'Pre-election gimmick'It comes as figures showed 268 people arrived in the UK across the English Channel in five boats on Tuesday.A total of 7,567 people made the journey from January to April, provisional Home Office figures show.The figure is 27% higher than the number of arrivals recorded in the same period last year. Meanwhile, a first failed asylum seeker has gone to Rwanda under a separate voluntary removals programme.

According to the National Archives, which holds the ship's passenger list, there were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean.Several hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. These travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation.Many had served in the British armed forces in World War Two.Why did the Windrush generation come to Britain?In 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain.The government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy.Caribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity.Many of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS.In Pictures: The Windrush generationRare Windrush images on display in art trail2:00What was life like for first-generation Windrush migrants?What is Windrush Day?Commemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018.In 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked with a series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.Getty ImagesKing Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's ""profound and permanent contribution to British life"".

This included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa.1:35""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael BraithwaiteHowever, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status. It had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010.Those affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing.Many were also threatened with deportation.A review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.Windrush generation treatment 'appalling'Reality Check: How do you prove you're a UK resident?Home Office asks Windrush man's son for DNA testWhat did the government do about the Windrush scandal?1:06Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leadersIn April 2018, then-Prime Minister Theresa May apologised for their treatment. An inquiry was announced and a compensation scheme established.The inquiry, which reported in March 2020, said that the scandal was both ""foreseeable and avoidable"", and criticised ""a culture of disbelief and carelessness"" in the Home Office.The inquiry made 30 recommendations, including:a full Home Office review of the UK's ""hostile environment"" immigration policyappointing a migrants' commissionerestablishing a race advisory boardInquiry author Wendy Williams warned there was a ""grave risk"" of similar problems happening again without government action.Then-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full.PA MediaThen-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced plans to scrap three recommendations from Wendy Williams's reviewBut in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office was dropping three of the commitments:to appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for ""speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly""to give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powersto hold events with people affected to ""listen and reflect on their stories""Ms Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the ""confidence of the Windrush community"".How does the Windrush Compensation Scheme work?The Windrush Compensation Scheme was established in April 2019, and about 15,000 people were thought to be eligible. But the scheme has been consistently criticised for processing delays, low offers, and unfair rejections reversed on appeal.In 2021, the Home Affairs Committee of MPs found the scheme had itself become a further trauma for those eligible. It said many of those affected were ""still too fearful of the Home Office to apply"".In April 2023, Human Rights Watch said the scheme was ""failing"" victims, and repeated calls for it to be removed from the Home Office's control.In response, the Home Office said it was ""committed to righting the wrongs of Windrush"".The government insisted it would ensure ""similar injustices can never be repeated and [was] creating a Home Office worthy of every community it serves"".According to the latest Home Office update, as at February 2024, the scheme had paid more than £83.8m across 2,307 claims.

"24 October 2022","Rishi Sunak: What might the new Tory leader do as PM?","Rishi Sunak: What might the new Tory leader do as PM?24 October 2022ShareShareEPARishi Sunak is set to become the UK's next prime minister, after winning the race to replace Liz Truss as Conservative Party leader.The former chancellor did not make any policy pledges during the truncated four-day contest, or give any speeches or media interviews.It means his unsuccessful battle against Ms Truss to replace Boris Johnson over the summer remains the best indication of his policies.But after Ms Truss's tumultuous six-week premiership, big questions remain over his plans for office.What has he said about tax cuts and government borrowing?PA MediaDuring the summer leadership contest, Mr Sunak dismissed Ms Truss's plans for instant tax cuts as ""fairytale"" economics that would push up inflation.He cautioned that her plans risked higher government borrowing costs - a warning that resurfaced after financial turmoil following September's mini-budget did just that.Although he said he wanted to see tax cuts in the long-term, he said bringing inflation first under control should be the priority.As chancellor he raised National Insurance by 1.25p in the pound, a policy he defended throughout the campaign as necessary to fund health spending.Following Ms Truss's mini-budget, the rise is due to be reversed on 6 November. Mr Sunak has not said whether this cut will still go ahead.He also committed to raising corporation tax from 19% to 25% next April, a policy that remains on course after Ms Truss U-turned on her promise to scrap the rise.One area where he did commit to cuts, however, was income tax - pledging to lower the basic rate by 4% before the end of the next parliament.This included a 1% cut in April 2024, a reduction Ms Truss initially brought forward by a year before the commitment evaporated completely during her mini-budget U-turn.What were his pledges on energy and climate change?PA MediaHow best to protect households and businesses from sky-high energy costs came to dominate the latter weeks of the summer leadership race.Mr Sunak said he would scrap VAT on domestic energy bills for one year, a policy he had previously opposed as chancellor. He also said he would spend billions on further targeted relief for vulnerable groups. However, Ms Truss has since put in place a scheme to cap energy costs for both households and businesses, a policy predicted to cost £10bn a month.The scheme was originally due to run for two years - but as part of the U-turn on the mini-budget, will now be reviewed next April.Whether to scale the programme back further, or replace it entirely, is one of the biggest decisions now confronting Mr Sunak as prime minister.Over the summer, he did not follow Ms Truss in ruling out energy rationing this winter as part of plans to conserve supply.Like his predecessor, however, he said he would resist solar panels being installed on ""our best farmland"" - and backed fracking for shale gas where it is supported by local residents.He also said he was committed to the UK's target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. What did he say about the NHS and healthcare?EPAHealth policy was not a key battleground during the summer campaign, but saw Mr Sunak make a number of important commitments.The new prime minister promised to eliminate one year waiting times by September 2024, and get the number of people waiting for non-urgent treatment in England falling by next year.He pledged to do this by boosting the number of ""diagnostic hubs"" outside hospitals, including by repurposing empty High Street shops.In a bid to reduce waste, he also said he would fine people £10 for missing a GP or hospital appointment.He also pledged to reform dentists' NHS contract, and ringfence the annual £3bn NHS dentistry budget. What are some of his other commitments? The summer contest also saw Mr Sunak make a number of commitments on immigration, including keeping the UK's controversial scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. He also pledged to place an annual cap on the number of refugees the UK accepts, tighten asylum qualification criteria, and withhold aid from countries that won't take migrant returns.Unlike Ms Truss, he did not pledge to raise defence spending to 3% of national income by 2030 - instead saying he wants the current 2% target to be seen as a floor.On Brexit, another key area, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""fix"" trading problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and reform all EU laws still on the UK lawbook by the next general election.Rishi Sunak: PM battling to stay in No 10Conservative PartyRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63374316"
"27 December 2023","Labour considers processing asylum seekers overseas","Labour considers processing asylum seekers overseas27 December 2023ShareFiona Nimoni, Iain WatsonBBC NewsSharePA MediaThe Labour party is considering processing some asylum claims overseas if it forms the next government. Sir Keir Starmer has been looking over new plans for Labour's asylum policy, a spokesman told the BBC.Asked last week if his party would consider processing asylum claims outside of the UK, Sir Keir said he would look at any plan that works.The Conservatives accused Labour of having no credible plan to stop migrants coming to the UK in boats.The Labour party is exploring whether some asylum seekers could have their claims processed before reaching the UK, to discourage some of them from making the journey across the Channel.Multiple senior sources have told the BBC that shadow ministers and officials have been discussing this as part of a mix of measures to tackle crossings. However, no detailed plans have yet been drawn up.The sources denied reports in The Times on Tuesday that detailed plans had been drawn up.Labour has ruled out any option that could see asylum seekers deported to other countries while their claims are being assessed - the cornerstone of Rishi Sunak's Rwanda scheme.Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Sunak takes the win but the battle is not overCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Speaking to the BBC earlier this month Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said she opposed the Rwanda scheme because it came with a ""huge cost"" and would only see a small number of people sent to Rwanda.Under a five-year trial first announced by the government in April 2022,  some asylum seekers arriving in the UK could be sent to Rwanda for processing.On arrival, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay. If not, they could apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another ""safe third country"".The government has been unable to send a single asylum seeker to Rwanda because of various legal challenges. The Supreme Court ruled the policy was unlawful in November and new emergency legislation was drawn up to revive the government's plan.Many Tory MPs had originally threatened to vote down the bill and some on the right of the party rebelled by abstaining - including Robert Jenrick, who resigned as immigration minister over the legislation.While the bill passed its first vote in Parliament on 12 December, there will be further votes in the House of Commons in the new year which could pose a challenge for Rishi Sunak. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC that ""as Keir said before, we'll look at anything that works but our priority is smashing the gangs and stopping people getting here in the first place, rather than working out how to process claims"".The government's Minister for Countering Illegal Immigration Michael Tomlinson said Labour's plans were not ""a deterrent to stop the boats, it just throws open the front door to Britain, increasing immigration. ""The National Crime Agency says that only a deterrent will stop the boats. Rishi Sunak's Rwanda plan is a deterrent,"" he said.A spokesman for Momentum, on the left wing of the Labour party, said that an expansion of safe routes for refugees was ""a practical alternative to the Tories' cruel and divisive war on migrants"".

"19 November 2023","Laura Kuenssberg: Reshuffle deals drama but voters more worried about wallets","Laura Kuenssberg: Reshuffle deals drama but voters more worried about wallets19 November 2023ShareLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergShareBBCCrash, bang, wallop! An adrenaline hit of headlines. A massive bust-up. A big surprise. And a clash in the courts. Westminster's gorged itself this week on some of its favourite pastimes: obsessing over who is slithering up or down in the game of political snakes and ladders; pondering the edges of our stretchy, unwritten constitution as the courts and government do battle; and, of course, frantically trying to predict what is next. Fully paid-up political nerds, myself included, have been glued to the spectacle of the last seven days. Bitter sackings, vitriolic public letters, the prime minister vowing to take on the courts, even talk of letters calling for his resignation going in. (""You'd just look like idiots,"" one senior MP tells me he told his more excitable colleagues.) Sunak denies 'tinkering' to save Rwanda planWhy did the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Suella Braverman accuses PM of betrayalBut for the ultimate boss, the voter, all the drama might have fallen on confused, or even deaf, ears. The signals from government have been mixed, to put it diplomatically. In all the soap opera, has the prime minister been moving to the left or to the right?Getting rid of Suella Braverman at the start of the week, gave the impression No 10 wanted to take a softer tack.But when the Supreme Court ruled against the government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda, up popped Rishi Sunak with seemingly tough language, claiming he won't let ""foreign courts"", stand in his way. In fact, the ruling was based on both international and UK law, so the notion the problem has been created just by meddling courts in a faraway land is misleading. Whatever your view of the plans, the court referred to British laws that say refugees must not be put at a real risk of harm. And the PM promised ""emergency"" new laws - political speak for plans that need to sound bold and important. Yes, that's the party that sees itself as the bastion of law and order, saying when it doesn't like the long-predicted verdict of our highest court, it will just change the rules instead, with the prime minister vowing to do ""whatever it takes"" to make it happen. Whatever it takes? That's not entirely true, because No 10 does not seem willing to follow the much more drastic steps sketched out, entirely predictably, by the departing home secretary to get planes in the sky. It's worth saying whatever Downing Street comes up with (and watch this space), the chances of keeping the right of the Tory party happy appear vanishingly small. Members of the public would be absolutely entitled this weekend to be scratching their heads and wondering if the controversial plan the prime minister has committed to time and again, the ""stop the boats"" slogan that screeches from government lecterns, is ever really going to happen. Research carried out by the polling group, More in Common, helps explore the real world reaction. And a flavour of voters' views from focus groups about Mrs Braverman suggests there is real division - the most common words chosen to describe her include, ""brave"" and ""outspoken"", but ""racist"" features there too.Then a former PM was brought back into the fold. ""Cameron??"" to quote one of the messages that blew up on my phone when the news broke.It was job done for No 10 if they wanted to create headlines out of their reshuffle that would distract from the Suella show. There were MPs on his former wing of the much-changed Conservative Party who were delighted that someone with his experience is back in town. That was reflected by voters too, with comments in focus groups such as: ""Old knowledge in a team is always good"", while another said: ""He's probably been brought back to give the party some sort of stability because at the moment it just seems to be a lot of just infighting.""The word voters chose more than any other to describe the now Lord Cameron was ""experienced"". Tick! But words like ""Brexit"" and ""past"" and ""idiot"" feature pretty heavily too.Here are the words voters used:More in CommonYou wouldn't be alone if you felt a bit puzzled. That's not just because you might have to squint to imagine how the leader of the failed Remain campaign can become the architect of UK foreign policy after Brexit. As one voter said: ""I'm really angry about it if I'm honest. I think he really divided the country down to families being one side of the argument or the other."" But it also risks highlighting the government's dreadful polling position, as well as the experience gap between the current and former prime minister, as if the much younger Rishi Sunak has got in trouble, lost his bus fare and has had to phone his dad to come and pick him up. One senior party figure asked: ""Who is the prime minister here? Sunak is the prefect and Cameron's the headmaster."" That point is picked up by some voters, one remarking: ""It kind of smacks of desperation a bit, because they've had to resort to that in order to get any kind of stability in the party."" There's another point of confusion. Rishi Sunak's last big swing was at the Conservative Party conference when he styled himself as the candidate of change, hammering the point by criticising what he called the 30-year consensus and the status quo. This was no small move, but a considered big strategic decision to pitch the prime minister like this, when other tacks had failed. Now, in blunt terms, how can you convincingly be the change guy, if you are bringing back the old guy?  Inevitably this changing tack has been noticed by the backbenches. One senior figure says: ""We have all been trying to read the tea leaves, but not able to drink the tea"" because ""No 10 keeps changing its mind all the time."" Whether on small boats or David Cameron sauntering back into government, all the hullabaloo in Westminster this week hasn't been on the stresses and strains most relevant to most voters' lives. ReutersJeremy Hunt has a chance to show the Tories are listening to people's concerns with the Autumn StatementResearch shared with us this week from More in Common, consistent with polling for months and months, shows that making ends meet is by miles at the top of the list - 71% of those asked put it as their highest concern. Worries about the NHS was the next priority, but some distance behind at 40%. Only 17% named asylum seekers crossing the channel as their biggest worry, behind climate change at 23%. It's foolish to read too much into any one snapshot, and one week of polling is, of course, just that. But as the prime minister wriggles uncomfortably over his chosen small boats priority, as the Tory party wrangles over the direction No 10 really wants to take, it is a reminder that neither of those issues are the public's most common concern. What is the Autumn Statement and when is it?What is inheritance tax and will it be cut?One senior Tory MP admits: ""Most people just want to be able to pay their bills and get a doctor's appointment.""On Wednesday, the Chancellor has a chance to help people do just that with the Autumn Statement. On this week's show are Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and shadow chancellor Rachel ReevesWatch live on the BBC News website, BBC One and iPlayer from 09:00 BST on SundayThe pressure is on Jeremy Hunt to act on those very real concerns. Number 10 was cock-a-hoop, at least for half an hour or so, when this week's inflation numbers showed price rises slowing down, mainly due to falling energy prices. But remember, slowing inflation doesn't remove high prices, it just means costs aren't going up so fast. As that polling suggests, making ends meet is a challenge for millions of families. From the splurge of early briefings it is not clear what Jeremy Hunt will actually propose to do to help. There's also the potential political contradiction of dangling a tax cut for a tiny number of families affected by inheritance tax, while taking much more from millions in income tax. That is not because the Chancellor has actually put income tax up, but because more and more people are getting dragged into paying higher rates. (This has one of the least attractive names in Treasury jargon, fiscal drag, but is one of the most significant and little talked about changes to how the government makes its sums add up.) It is also, at the risk of sounding prim, worth noting how unusual it is for the Treasury to be teasing quite so much around tax cuts just before a big statement like this. One former Treasury minister told me it's ""extraordinary"" they have been so open. Is it - as they archly note - ""just to chuck red meat to the Suella brigade"" after a bumpy week? The overall economic picture is not pretty. Growth has stalled. The government is spending an absolute fortune paying interest on its huge debts. Taxes and government spending are both at historic levels, a nightmare for Conservative purists who, after all, hope their party stands for leaner government and lower tax.It is a challenge to those in the Conservative Party, and, of course, the opposition, who want more resources for public services. Overall the former Treasury minister notes brutally, ""we are in a really bad spot - do I see a coherent strategy? No!""  The overwhelming concern for the chancellor and the prime minister to respond to is to help families and firms feel consistently better off. The drama that's consumed Westminster these last seven days isn't likely to make much difference to that. Jeremy Hunt has a chance to change that on Wednesday. But it's just not clear that the neighbours in No 10 and 11 can make the sums, and the politics, add up.Follow Laura on XWhat questions would you like to ask the chancellor and the shadow chancellor?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

"27 September 2023","Anti-gay discrimination not qualification for asylum, says Suella Braverman","Anti-gay discrimination not qualification for asylum, says Suella Braverman27 September 2023ShareHenry Zeffman & Sam FrancisBBC PoliticsShare1:25Braverman: Allowing people to claim asylum after travelling through safe countries is ""absurd and unsustainable""Fearing discrimination for being gay or a woman should not be enough to qualify for international refugee protection, the UK home secretary has said.Addressing a US think tank on Tuesday, Suella Braverman questioned whether the application of the UN's 1951 Refugee Convention is ""fit for our modern age"".Laws have morphed from helping those fleeing persecution to those fearing bias, she argued.Labour accused her of having ""given up on fixing"" the asylum system.""Now she's resorting to grandstanding abroad and looking for anyone else to blame,"" said shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper.She accused the home secretary of using gay people and women as ""scapegoats"" rather than ""recognising her responsibility to get a grip of the asylum system"".Where it's illegal to be gayHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Government committed to Rwanda plan, Braverman saysWhy is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial?The Refugee Convention was drawn up following World War Two, and has at its centre the principle that refugees should not be returned to countries where they face threats to their life or freedom.The home secretary told an audience at the right-wing American Enterprise Institute (AEI) in Washington DC that ""we now live in a completely different time"" from when the convention was signed.She said: ""As case law has developed, what we have seen in practice is an interpretive shift away from 'persecution', in favour of something more akin to a definition of 'discrimination'.""The practical consequence of which has been to expand the number of those who may qualify for asylum, and to lower the threshold for doing so.""The definition grants the right for at least 780 million people worldwide to move to another country, according to the Margaret Thatcher-founded think tank, the Centre for Policy Studies.According to the UN the total number of refugees worldwide is much lower, with 35 million people registered as refugees in 2022.On Tuesday morning, Police Minister Chris Philp told the BBC the convention was being exploited by ""economic migrants to try and claim asylum to move between countries"".What is the Refugee Convention?The Convention was drawn up in 1951 and came into force three years later, during an era where millions were displaced across Europe after World War TwoIt was originally drafted to focus specifically on Europe's post-war refugees - but a 1967 amendment removed the geographic and time limits included in the original text and made the Convention universalThe Convention provides an agreed definition of a refugee, establishes basic minimum standards for their treatment, and says that refugees should not be penalised for breaching immigration rules while fleeingIts core principle is ""non-refoulement"" - which means refugees should not be returned or expelled from a country against their will if they fear for their life or freedomAlmost 150 countries have signed up to the ConventionMrs Braverman also used her speech to attack ""a misguided dogma of multiculturalism"".""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate,"" she said adding: ""It has failed because it allowed people to come to our society and live parallel lives in it. ""And, in extreme cases, they could pursue lives aimed at undermining the stability and threatening the security of society.""The home secretary said her parents - who migrated to the UK from Mauritius and Kenya - ""both signed up to British values wholeheartedly"".Despite speaking thousands of miles across the Atlantic, Ms Braverman's comments are almost certainly designed to spark debate back in Westminster.Her decision to visit Washington, and make such a punchy speech, will inevitably be seen through the lens of her own leadership ambitions. She ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative leadership last summer and is a likely candidate to stand again should Rishi Sunak lose the next general election.In her speech Ms Braverman said: ""Let me be clear, there are vast swathes of the world where it is extremely difficult to be gay, or to be a woman. Where individuals are being persecuted, it is right that we offer sanctuary.""But we will not be able to sustain an asylum system if in effect, simply being gay, or a woman, and fearful of discrimination in your country of origin is sufficient to qualify for protection.There are 64 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality, nearly half of which are in Africa.Refugee 'cornerstone'Given that much of the world is signed up to the existing convention it is unlikely Ms Braverman will manage to drive through reforms. But Ms Braverman has started a debate which highlights the government's determination to take a tough approach on migration. The UN has told the BBC that the Convention on Refugees remains ""the cornerstone of refugee protection"", which has saved ""millions of lives"".Shabia Mantoo, of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said the convention did not need reform but instead needed ""international political will and commitment to abide by the obligations for refugees under the international legal framework"".There has also been a backlash from some in the home secretary's own party.Andrew Boff, a long-serving Conservative member on the London Assembly and patron of the LGBT+ Tories, said ""a small minority"" of refugees come to the UK.""I have confidence that her dog whistles won't be heard internationally so she should spend her time on sorting out the appalling backlog of asylum claims rather than distracting us by victim blaming,"" Mr Boff said.But Tim Loughton, a Conservative member of the Home Affairs Committee, said Ms Braverman ""had a point"".""The UK cannot be the refugee camp for the entire world and that's why we need to look at exactly how these international agreements can work in the 2020s,"" he told the BBC.PA MediaSuella Braverman will also speak to her US counterparts in Washington DCThe question of the right way to define a refugee also feeds into the broader debate about illegal immigration and how to stop people arriving in the UK in small boats. The home secretary's speech comes as the government prepares for a Supreme Court hearing on whether its plan for tackling small boat crossings is legal. The government wants to send those who come into the UK illegally to Rwanda or a third country. The UNHCR has strongly criticised the government's plan arguing it would ""deny protection"" to genuine refugees and was a ""clear breach"" of the Refugee Convention. Analysis In 2022, there were 1,334 asylum applications lodged in the UK, where sexual orientation was part of the basis for the claim. This represents 1.5% of 74,751 asylum claims made last year.The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria. In all three countries consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal. They are punishable by life imprisonment and, in some parts of northern Nigeria, by death (according to The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association)However, sexual orientation may not be the only grounds on which the asylum applications were made. Also, we do not know whether sexual orientation influenced the outcome of the claims.Suella BravermanRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66919416"
"13 November 2023","Who is Suella Braverman?","Who is Suella Braverman?13 November 2023ShareSam FrancisPolitical reporter, BBC NewsShare1:08Watch: Braverman's most controversial moments... in 68 secondsSuella Braverman has been forced out as home secretary after challenging the prime minister one too many times.She was sacked from the role on Monday morning.In an article for the Times newspaper, she accused the Metropolitan Police of bias in the policing of protests. Mrs Braverman was accused of undermining the police with her claim that aggressive right-wing protesters were ""rightly met with a stern response"", while ""pro-Palestinian mobs"" were ""largely ignored"", ahead of pro-Palestinian marches in central London.The row is just the latest in a long line of controversies in Mrs Braverman's political career.But it has not stopped her emerging as a leading figure on the right of the Conservative Party and someone with ambitions to lead it.No 10 disowns Braverman attack on policeWhy Suella Braverman can't stop Palestinian protestsThe now former home secretary's political leanings were evident at an early age. In 1997, the year of Labour's landslide victory, she won a mock election as the Conservative candidate at her independent all-girls school in Harrow.A classmate at the time said she had turned the school ""in completely the opposite direction"" during the election, using her ""personality, joviality and optimism"".Mrs Braverman was born Sue-Ellen Fernandes, in April 1980 - named after Sue-Ellen Ewing, the matriarch of the American TV show Dallas, one of her mother's favourite shows.Teachers shortened it to Suella at school, where she was a high-flying student - crowning her time there as head girl.Her parents were both of Indian origin, and met in London, after her father fled Kenya and mother emigrated from Mauritius to become a nurse.She has spoken about how her parents' journey and emphasis on hard work and integration deeply influenced her. This drive took her to study law at University of Cambridge, where she chaired the university's Conservative Association - a post held by Tory grandees (and former home secretaries) Ken Clarke and Michael Howard.After Cambridge, she studied for two years in Paris, gaining a postgraduate degree in European and French law at Panthéon-Sorbonne University, and developing a love for the works of Marcel Proust and songs of Belgian singer Jacques Brel.Political riseMrs Braverman's legal career took her from the UK to the US, passing the bar exam in both London and New York. She was also set on politics, gaining work as a lawyer for the government and unsuccessfully standing as the Conservative candidate in the solid Labour seat of Leicester East in 2005. She was selected as the Conservative candidate for the safe seat of Fareham, a role she secured by doing the most ""homework"" according to a member of her selection panel.In the 2015 election she was duly elected as an MP, and quickly made a name for herself for her views on the EU, immigration, and law and order.A fervent supporter of Brexit, she chaired the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs, after the UK left the EU. It was in the melee following the 2016 referendum that she headed to her ministerial office - getting a job as a junior minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU). She resigned from the role 10 months later, alongside her boss at DExEU Dominic Raab, in protest at Theresa May's Brexit deal, which she called ""a betrayal"".She changed her name to Suella Braverman, having married South African business executive Rael Braverman in 2019.Sir John Hayes, one of Mrs Braverman's oldest allies in politics, said Rael ""reinforced"" his wife's conservatism.ReutersMrs Braverman made a return to government when she was appointed attorney general by Boris Johnson, but maintained an independent streak.As the chief legal adviser to the government, she was criticised by lawyers for backing the Internal Market Bill - setting post-Brexit customs and trade rules - which broke international law in a ""specific and limited way"".She also made history in 2021 as the first cabinet minister to take maternity leave, following the passage of a new law.Following Mr Johnson's resignation as prime minister, Mrs Braverman was the first to announce she was running to replace him.  She was installed as home secretary by eventual winner Liz Truss, but was forced to resign within the space of a few weeks.Mrs Braverman stood down after admitting to sharing confidential documents.Return to office   In a political twist, Mrs Braverman was reinstated as home secretary by Rishi Sunak - and under him, she has carved out a reputation for her headline-grabbing comments. Not long after returning to office, it emerged she had been caught speeding while attorney general. Mr Sunak decided her request for advice from officials on arranging a private course ""did not amount to a breach of the ministerial code"" without the need for an investigation.Mrs Braverman's comments have often proved a thorn in Mr Sunak's side, with the prime minister repeatedly distancing himself from her language on immigration and homeless people.Until recently, Mr Sunak appeared unwilling to rein in his home secretary. There had been suggestions Mrs Braverman acted as a ""politically useful pressure valve"" for Mr Sunak - allowing him to indirectly signal approval for right-wing populist policies without having to make those statements himself. Now her departure marks the end of a tumultuous period in government, but is unlikely to end her leadership ambitions.Listen to Suella Braverman's interview on Political Thinking with Nick Robinson.No 10 disowns Braverman attack on policeIs Suella Braverman facing the sack?Why Suella Braverman can't stop Palestinian protestsEuropean court at odds with UK values - BravermanSuella Braverman","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67137926"

""Reshuffling of the deckchairs will not deliver the proper energy policy Britain needs,"" he added.Some Tory MPs had expected Mr Sunak to carry out a more wide-ranging reshuffle, ahead of next month's Conservative Party conference and the King's Speech, setting out the government's priorities. But the prime minister, who had to replace Ben Wallace after he announced he was standing down as defence secretary, has opted to play it safe for now. Some expect a wider reshuffle before the next general election, although some Tories fear the PM may run out of time.'Looking forward'In his first statement as defence secretary, Mr Shapps said was ""honoured"" to take on the role and pledged to ""continue to UK's support for Ukraine"".Mr Shapps paid tribute to the ""enormous contribution Mr Wallace has made to UK defence and global security over the last four years"".""I am looking forward to working with the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who defend our nation's security,"" he added.ReutersMs Coutinho will be the youngest minister around the Cabinet tableMr Shapps has held seven cabinet roles since 2012.Last October, he spent six days as home secretary during the final chaotic week of Liz Truss' premiership, following the resignation of Suella Braverman from that role.He was then appointed business secretary by Mr Sunak, when he became prime minister after Ms Truss.Mr Shapps' longest stint in government has been as transport secretary where he negotiated repeated bailouts for Transport for London during the Covid-19 pandemic.Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mr Shapps has taken a visible role in the UK's support of the country.He took part in the Homes for Ukraine scheme, hosting a family of refugees at his Hertfordshire home.Mr Shapps visited Ukraine last week, in his previous role as energy secretary, to highlight the UK government's role in guaranteeing a supply of enriched uranium to the country's nuclear power plants.'Political appointee'Mr Shapps lack of experience in foreign affairs, defence and security has concerned some Conservative MPs and army figures.One anonymous minister said Mr Sunak had gone for ""media over capabilities"". ""The 'minister for the Today Programme' is the minister for defence,"" they added.Former head of the British army Lord Dannatt said: ""The big question is whether Grant Shapps is going to be a political appointee to support the prime minister in cabinet or is he going to understand the needs of defence.""He will have to work really hard to understand his portfolio at a Whitehall level and how the armed forces work.""Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey congratulated Mr Shapps on his appointment. He said he would work with his opposite number ""to keep our country safe"" - but added that ""after 13 years of Tory defence failures, a change at the top will not change this record"".Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Richard Foord said Mr Sunak had appointed a ""yes man"", who will be in charge of ""slashing troop numbers by 10,000"".""They have taken the armed forces for granted for too long, and we are all left less safe as a result,"" Mr Foord said.David Johnston, a Tory backbencher who previously ran a social mobility charity, takes over Ms Coutinho's role as children's minister at the Department for Education.Mr Wallace, who served as defence secretary for four years under three prime ministers, said he was stepping down ""to invest in the parts of life that I have neglected, and to explore new opportunities"".In his resignation letter, Mr Wallace said his military and political careers has come at ""a personal toll to me and my family"".Mr Wallace leaves parliament as one of the longest serving ministers in government.As defence secretary he oversaw the evacuation of personnel from Afghanistan. He became a high-profile and ardent supporter of Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, cajoling other nations to respond to President Zelensky's call for weapons to repel the Russian threat.He also called for an increase in forces funding claiming the British army had been ""hollowed out"" over 30 years.Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Mr Wallace ""led by example"" whose work ""inspired other countries to join in assisting Ukraine"".In a statement Mr Reznikov said he wants to thank his ""friend and colleague"" for ""everything he has done for Ukraine while in his position"".Conservative PartyGrant ShappsBen Wallace","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66668941"

If you have not been following the story, here's what you need to know.He used to be in charge of the UK's tax systemPrime Minister Rishi Sunak made him Conservative Party chairman in October, in charge of fundraising and election campaigns. But his highest-profile job was being chancellor - the UK's finance minister - for the final two months of Boris Johnson's time in Downing Street.His own finances have been in the spotlightIt recently emerged that whilst he was chancellor, he reached a multi-million pound tax settlement with HMRC, the UK's tax authority. It related to the allocation of shares in YouGov, the polling company he set up before he became an MP. Mr Sunak asked a top adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, to investigate, saying there were ""questions that need answering"".The investigation has just concludedSir Laurie found Mr Zahawi had been in contact with HMRC over his taxes since April 2021, reaching an agreement last August and finalising the settlement in September. But he found Mr Zahawi hadn't done enough to declare this within government, and had failed to be open enough in public about what had been going on. He said this breached the behaviour rules for government ministers.Rishi Sunak agreed with the inquiry The prime minister is the only person who can decide whether Mr Zahawi broke the rules. He said Mr Zahawi had committed a ""serious breach"" of the guidelines and decided to fire him.He's thought to be a multimillionaireMr Zahawi has held several government jobs. Before he was a politician, he was an entrepreneur, once setting up a company selling merchandise for the Teletubbies TV show. It's thought he made the bulk of his fortune, estimated at up to £100m, through setting up YouGov.He was a child refugee from Saddam HusseinBorn in Baghdad to an influential Kurdish family in 1967, he fled Iraq with them at the age of nine. He grew up in Sussex and went to university in London, before following his father into business. He later worked for ex-Tory MP and bestselling novelist Lord Archer during his failed campaign to become London mayor.There are still questions for Mr SunakThe prime minister says he followed ""the right process"" by asking Sir Laurie to investigate, and acted ""pretty decisively"" when his inquiry finished. But opposition parties have questioned whether the inquiry was necessary, saying he should have sacked Mr Zahawi before. And they say Mr Sunak still has questions to answer about exactly what he knew before appointing him Tory chairman.

"20 April 2023","Migration bill: Home secretary set to win powers to ignore European court","Migration bill: Home secretary set to win powers to ignore European court20 April 2023ShareHelen Catt & Joshua NevettBBC PoliticsShareGetty ImagesPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has made curbing illegal migration one of his main prioritiesThe home secretary is expected to be given the ability to ignore attempts by European judges to halt migrant deportations from the UK. The change will be made to the Illegal Migration Bill, after the government made concessions to Conservative MPs. The move should avoid a rebellion from some MPs, who have been demanding tougher action against the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The change will be made in amendments when the bill returns to the Commons.As part of the amendment, Home Secretary Suella Braverman is expected to gain the power, in certain circumstances, to ignore interim injunctions from the court, known as Rule 39 orders, that halt deportation flights. The Strasbourg-based court, unpopular with the Tory right, used an injunction of this type to block the removal of migrants to Rwanda last year.Rebel Tory MPs say they have also agreed with ministers that British judges will only be able to halt deportations where there is a risk of serious and irreversible harm. BBC Newsnight has been told some movement is also expected on the provision of safe and legal routes for refugees to come to the UK - which is a key demand of another group of Conservative MPs. The migration legislation, which was set out by Ms Braverman last month, would prevent anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum.It is central to Mr Sunak's pledge to stop small boats crossing the English Channel, but has provoked outrage among charities and opposition parties, who say it breaches international law.What are the legal routes to the UK?Ministers see off Tory rebels over migration plansWhat does Rishi Sunak's promise to stop the boats mean?Some Conservative MPs, however, believe it does not go far enough and tabled a series of changes to the bill.Last month, some of those MPs withdrew their proposals in Parliament after immigration minister Robert Jenrick said he would engage with those who have concerns. Conservative MP Danny Kruger, who was among those leading the calls, said he was ""grateful to the prime minister and the home secretary for their work"".Mr Kruger said the British public ""are fed up with London lawyers and Strasbourg judges getting in the way of a sensible migration policy"".He said he was ""hopeful that the government will be able to deliver the prompt removals to Rwanda and other safe countries"". This was needed, he said, ""to stop the boats and lay the foundation of a fair and humane asylum system"".New powersMore than 45,000 people entered the UK via Channel crossings last year, up from about 300 in 2018.Under the new bill, people removed from the UK would be blocked from returning or seeking British citizenship in future. Migrants will not get bail or be able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention.It will also place a legal duty on the home secretary to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country - this will take legal precedence over someone's right to claim asylum.In a letter to MPs following publication of the bill, Ms Braverman conceded there is a ""more (than) 50% chance"" the bill is incompatible with international law.It is expected to come up against opposition in the House of Lords, and subsequently expected to face a wave of legal challenges, whilst opposition parties have dismissed it as unworkable.Former Lord Chief Justice and crossbench peer Lord Thomas said ignoring interim injunctions from the ECHR would be an ""immensely serious step"" and warned it ""sets an extraordinarily bad example"". ""Many people would say having the power to ignore a court order is something - unless the circumstances were quite extraordinary - this is a step a government should never take because it is symbolic of a breach of the rule of law,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Ministers see off Tory rebels over migration plansThe hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillWill this migrant bill become a reality?Home OfficeRefugees and asylum seekersMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65331272"
"23 January 2024","Rwanda asylum scheme: Peers vote against approving Rwanda treaty","Rwanda asylum scheme: Peers vote against approving Rwanda treaty23 January 2024ShareSam Francis & Harry FarleyPolitical reporter & political correspondent, BBC NewsShareReutersHome Secretary James Cleverly signed the new treaty with Rwanda's foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta in Kigali last yearIn the first vote of its kind, the House of Lords has called for the new UK-Rwanda treaty to be delayed until Kigali improves its asylum procedures.Peers backed a non-binding motion urging the government not to ratify the treaty, by 214 votes to 171.The treaty, signed in December, is central to Rishi Sunak's scheme to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda but is separate to the Rwanda Safety Bill.Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urged his fellow peers to back the bill.""It's not acceptable to have people travelling from a perfectly safe country - France - to another safe country - Britain - and to be able to stay, and that's what the Rwanda plan is all about,"" he said. In a news conference last week, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged the House of Lords not to block the ""will of the people"" by voting down the bill.Next week peers will begin debating the proposed legislation which aims to prevent legal challenges to deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda. While non-binding, the vote on the treaty gives an indication of the level of opposition Mr Sunak is likely to face when the bill is debated in the Lords.But only one Conservative - the Earl of Dundee - rebelled against the government in Monday night's vote.The vote was the first to be held under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 - which set out new methods for the Lords to reject treaty ratification.Rwanda treaty deals with legal concerns - CleverlyUK lawyers could be based in Rwanda in asylum planWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Once the Rwanda Bill is passed, the treaty will officially be ratified - though the government does not need the backing of parliament to approve the treaty.The UK-Rwanda Treaty forms a central plank of the government's plan to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats. The treaty was drafted in response to the Supreme Court ruling that the Rwanda policy is unlawful.Home Secretary James Cleverly signed the new legally binding treaty in Kigali, which he said would ensure people relocated to Rwanda are not at risk of being returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened - a process known as non-refoulement.The treaty also establishes a new appeal body, which will be made up of judges with asylum expertise from a range of countries, to hear individual cases.The government says Rwanda's asylum system would be monitored by an independent committee, whose powers to enforce the treaty would be beefed up.The Monitoring Committee will develop a system which will enable relocated people and their lawyers to lodge complaints, the government says.But the House of Lords backed a motion on Monday saying the treaty should wait until the government is able to prove Rwanda is safe.The motion was proposed by a Labour former Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, on behalf of the cross-party International Agreements Committee which listed 10 outstanding issues in the Rwandan asylum system.The committee published a report last week that argued protections promised by the Rwanda Treaty, have not yet been introduced.Lord Goldsmith said: ""The government has already presented a Bill to Parliament asking it to make a judgment that Rwanda is safe now.""And yet on the home secretary's own evidence it cannot be so because the measures are not in place and have not been shown to be effective,The Liberal Democrat spokesperson Lord Fox added: ""There is more than enough reason to delay the ratification of the treaty until the conditions for its lawful operation are actually in place.""Although the vote is not binding on the government, it could feature in future legal challenges against the policy.Rwanda treaty deals with legal concerns - CleverlyRefugees and asylum seekersRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68059862"
"19 January 2024","Rwanda bill passes but poll gloom still haunts PM","Rwanda bill passes but poll gloom still haunts PM19 January 2024ShareChris MasonPolitical editor, BBC News•@ChrisMasonBBCShareReutersThe lectern was back with its three word promise: ""Stop the Boats.""Within minutes of the government completing the latest lap of its Rwanda policy legislative and legal marathon - winning Wednesday night's key vote - reporters were told the prime minister would be holding a news conference first thing on Thursday.Several dozen of us rolled up at the Downing Street briefing room in 9 Downing Street to hear Rishi Sunak emerge from the din of his own party's two day squabble over whether his Rwanda plan is a dud.As I've reported throughout this week, there had been a quiet confidence in government for days that when the main vote came, whether MPs backed the policy in its entirety or not, ministers would get their way.The whips, responsible for discipline, were pretty sure their intelligence was solid and they knew how Conservative MPs intended to vote.But they were acutely conscious too that Rishi Sunak had suffered his three biggest rebellions in the course of just two days, as around 60 of his MPs attempted to change his plans.Sunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billTory deputy chairs resign to rebel over Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?One senior figure reflected to me that you just never know if an act of rebellion will prompt a rebellion hangover in an MP, remorseful at their decision to defy the prime minister, or give them a first taste of something irresistible that compels them to make it a habit.The news conference wasn't a real moment of victory. But it was the absence of defeat.No-one outside Westminster will cheer a bill passing what's called third reading.Some, such as Labour, the Liberal Democrats and others, will maintain that the policy is ridiculous.And its advocates and others will - and do still - ask all the same questions, and don't get straight answers, not least the big one: will any migrants actually be sent to Rwanda before the general election?Rishi Sunak doesn't offer a straight answer to that question because he can't. He is not in control of the House of Lords or the courts, and they both could gum up his plan to get a plane off to Kigali soon.But Mr Sunak didn't seek to use this moment to change the record and talk about something else. Instead he wanted to continue talking about illegal immigration, and turn his focus to Labour. There has been a deep frustration within Downing Street at the government's relative inability to do this, such has been the noise from their own side.That said, I didn't manage to tempt the ever-disciplined prime minister to offer any public criticism of his bickering backbenchers when I got the chance to ask him a question.In taking the political tussle to Labour he repeatedly used the phrase ""back to square one"" to describe how he thought Keir Starmer would handle the issue - and tried to draw a dividing line between his willingness to slog on with his Rwanda idea, and Labour's commitment to ditch it.Instead, as he also said repeatedly, he would ""stick to the plan"".That phrase is an illustration of the latest about turn in the Conservatives' campaigning strategy. Having briefly pitched himself, at the Conservative conference in the autumn, as an agent of change, he has now switched to the more conventional electoral approach of a party long in government: stick with the folk you know, don't trust the other lot.The thing is, having tried change and continuity, the opinion polls remain dire for the Tories. The political story of 2023 was Rishi Sunak's inability to budge the polls.Just this week there has been a YouGov polls for The Times and the Daily Telegraph, which both look desperate from No10's perspective.This piles gloom on top of bad blood for many Conservatives, fearful for their jobs while also irritated either at the behaviour of their rebellious colleagues or at the way the government has handled things.Yet again there are mutters that a handful of Tory MPs have submitted letters calling for a vote of confidence in Rishi Sunak.Only one Conservative MP has publicly acknowledged they have done this - Dame Andrea Jenkyns.And talk of further letters should be treated with a decent dose of scepticism, because proving they have, unless an MP publishes their letter, is almost impossible.Nonetheless all this is the backdrop against which the prime minister is attempting to seize the initiative in a general election year: it is not remotely easy for him.Sunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billUK immigrationImmigrationRishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68023517"
"16 April 2024","MPs reject Lords amendments to Rwanda bill","MPs reject Lords amendments to Rwanda bill16 April 2024ShareNick Eardley, political correspondent & James Gregory & Chris Mason, political editorBBC NewsShareEPAThe Rwanda scheme was designed as a deterrent to small boat crossingsMPs have rejected all changes to the Rwanda bill made in the House of Lords in an ongoing parliamentary stand-off.The much-debated bill will now return to the upper chamber for further scrutiny on Tuesday. It comes as reports suggest the UK held talks with other countries, including Armenia, about replicating the scheme. The plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda has faced setbacks since it was first announced in April 2022 by Boris Johnson's government. The bill, which declares Rwanda safe, is likely to pass this week - with the government majority meaning any further amendments made by peers should be overturned.It will not become law until both Commons and Lords agree on the final wording, a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.It will now returns to the Lords, where peers are set to review it on Tuesday - possibly making additional changes that could extend the parliamentary disputes. In the vote on Monday, MPs rejected six amendments, one of which would have granted a removal exemption for people who had supported the UK's armed forces overseas. The government also rejected calls to exempt victims of modern slavery from the Rwanda scheme, instead proposing its own amendment that would provide an annual report on the impact of the policy on victims, which then passed. Chris Mason: Government hopes are high for Rwanda plan approvalWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Charities plan legal action against Rwanda removalsAs reported in the Times, internal government documents show Costa Rica, Ivory Coast and Armenia have been considered as options for similar schemes, if Rwanda proves successful.The BBC has seen some of the documents, which are from several months ago, and understands the list is accurate.The early stage plans are described by sources as in a ""holding pattern"", with other countries keen to see if the Rwanda plan actually gets going before trying anything similar themselves. Other African nations, including Morocco, Tunisia, Namibia and Gambia, ""explicitly declined"" to enter technical discussions, according to the Times.Sir Matthew Rycroft, the top civil servant at the Home Office said the document was ""out of date"" and it should not be assumed there are active negotiations with other countries. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee the Foreign Office had assessed a lot of countries but only ""a tiny number"" had progressed to the next stage.A government spokesperson said the UK ""is continuing to work with a range of international partners to tackle global illegal migration challenges"" but its current focus was on passing the Rwanda bill and putting plans in place to get flights off the ground as soon as possible. 'Doomed to fail'Labour believes the scheme is flawed and intends to scrap it if it wins the general election, expected to be held later this year. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the Rwanda scheme is ""doomed to fail"" calling it ""fundamentally unworkable, unaffordable and unlawful"".Sir Keir Starmer has said he would instead focus on targeting criminal gangs and negotiating new security arrangements with Europe.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Kinnock said he hoped the Conservatives ""will come to understand that hard graft and common sense are always more effective than the sugar rush of a tabloid front page"".Meanwhile, charities supporting asylum seekers are also planning to launch legal challenges ""as quickly as possible"" against deporting people to the east-central African country if the bill becomes law this week.Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti said the Lords amendments sought to improve the bill and did not attack ""the central plank of the policy"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her own amendment would restore ""the jurisdiction of domestic courts, who are defenestrated by this bill"". However, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes said legal appeals had been used to block deportations and ""frustrate"" the will of Parliament and government policy. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly said flights to Rwanda would take off by spring, but refused to name a specific date. Ministers believe the legislation will pave the way for the first removals to the country within weeks. The Safety of Rwanda Bill declares the country safe and was introduced to Parliament after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the government's scheme was unlawful.In its ruling, the court said genuine refugees being deported there would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm. The Rwanda scheme was originally introduced by then-Prime Minister Mr Johnson in April 2022 with the aim of acting as a deterrent to people from arriving in the UK on small boats across the English Channel.It has faced a number of legal challenges since, and so far no-one has been sent to the east African country under the scheme.The bill aims to protect the scheme from further legal setbacks.It comes as 534 migrants crossed the Channel in 10 boats on Sunday - the highest daily figure this year. It brings the total for 2024 so far to 6,265, an increase of 28% on the same period last year.

"1 December 2023","Rwanda scheme can save billions of pounds, claims Rishi Sunak","Rwanda scheme can save billions of pounds, claims Rishi Sunak1 December 2023ShareChas GeigerPolitical reporterSharePA MediaGetting the government's Rwanda plan right will ""literally save us billions in the long run"", Rishi Sunak has said. He made the claim to journalists on flight to Dubai for the COP28 climate summit, without giving details of where such savings would come from.He said he was ""completely confident"" his revised Rwanda plan ""complies with our international obligations"".Last month, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful. The prime minister now plans to sign a new treaty with the Rwandan government and to introduce emergency legislation declaring the scheme safe. Sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK illegally to Rwanda is a key plank of Mr Sunak's pledge to stop small boat crossings of the English Channel. Sunak denies 'tinkering' to save Rwanda planPM's new Rwanda plan won't work, says BravermanCritical that Rwanda flights take off - JenrickWhy did the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?But on 15 November, the Supreme Court upheld a Court of Appeal ruling that the policy would leave people sent to Rwanda open to human rights breaches, meaning the scheme could not be implemented in its current form. Speaking to journalists travelling on his flight to Dubai, Mr Sunak said the next stage would be bringing forward legislation to prove that the central African nation was safe, ""thereby making sure there are no more domestic blockers to the proper functioning of this scheme"".""We're finalising that at the moment. And it's important that we get it right because this is such a vital issue. ""But I'm clear about the goal here - the goal is to make sure that Parliament can declare unequivocally that on the basis of everything that we've done that Rwanda is a safe place to operationalise our scheme.""Mr Sunak did not elaborate on how billions of pounds could be saved. And he would not be drawn on how much he was prepared to spend on the scheme. But he insisted it would have a ""crucial"" deterrent effect, adding: ""If we can get that right, it will literally save us billions in the long run, so that is the right focus.""The government has not provided a total cost for the scheme. But an economic impact assessment prepared for the Illegal Migration Act estimated that removing an individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost £63,000 more than keeping them in the UK.The UK's asylum system costs £3bn a year. Around £8m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers.PA MediaThen-Home Secretary Suella Braverman tours a building site on the outskirts of the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where asylum seekers deported from the UK could be housedCritics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while they wait for confirmation of their status.Many Conservative MPs, including former Home Secretary Suella Braverman whom he sacked last month, have urged the prime minister to bring in tough legislation that includes ""notwithstanding"" clauses preventing judges from applying protections in the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to asylum cases.Some Tory MPs have called for the UK to withdraw from the ECHR entirely. But more than 20, including former senior cabinet minister Damian Green, chair of the One Nation group of Conservative MPs, have written to Mr Sunak urging him not to renege on the UK's human rights commitments. ""There are a significant number of Conservative MPs who want to ensure that we defend the rule of law and meet our international commitments,"" Mr Green told the BBC. Sir Bob Neill, Tory chair of the Commons justice committee, told the Financial Times: ""Many Conservative voters in traditional seats are uneasy with picking fights with the country's institutions and want to keep to the treaties we have entered into.""Government lawyers have warned that instructing the courts to ignore the ECHR risks opening up further avenues for migrants to challenge the legality of deportation flights, on the basis that it would breach Britain's convention obligations. Asked how far he was prepared to go on the ECHR, the prime minister said: "" I've also been clear that I won't allow a foreign court to block us from flights taking off.""My patience is wearing thin, the country's patience is wearing thin, we have to end this merry go round.""Mr Sunak said ""the government and the party is united behind that position but also the country is united on this"".  He added that while ""great progress"" had been made on the small boats issue - ""reducing the number of crossings by a third this year, something that everyone thought was impossible when I got this job - we've got more to go.""I want to finish the job and that's why I'll get the Rwanda scheme up and running.""Over 17,000 asylum seekers missing - Home OfficeSupreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulWhy the government has no good options on RwandaConservative PartyUK immigrationEuropean Convention on Human RightsRefugees and asylum seekersUK Supreme CourtRishi SunakDamian GreenRwandaMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67588407"
"6 December 2023","New Rwanda asylum treaty deals with Supreme Court concerns, says James Cleverly","New Rwanda asylum treaty deals with Supreme Court concerns, says James Cleverly6 December 2023ShareJoshua NevettPolitical reporter, BBC NewsShareReutersHome Secretary James Cleverly signed the new treaty with Rwanda's foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta in KigaliThe home secretary says a new treaty with Rwanda addresses the concerns of the UK's Supreme Court, which ruled the government's plan unlawful last month.The court said the policy, which would see migrants sent to Rwanda, was open to human rights breaches.James Cleverly insisted Rwanda had made ""a clear and unambiguous commitment to the safety of people who come here"".The policy is part of the government's plan to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said ""stopping the boats"" is one of five main priorities for his government ahead of the next general election.But the Rwanda scheme - which was first announced by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022 - has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to the country yet.Labour has also pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the next election, casting doubt over its long-term future.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the policy was ""failing"" - and funding for it would be better spent on ""going after"" the gangs that organise small boat crossings. Tougher visa rules unveiled in plan to cut migrationWhy did the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Legal migration is too high, says Rishi SunakThe Supreme Court, the UK's highest court, rejected the policy on the grounds that it could not be guaranteed the Rwandan government would honour a principle of international law known as non-refoulement.The principle forbids a country that receives asylum seekers from returning them to any country if doing so would put them at risk of harm.Following the ruling, Mr Sunak said his government would work on a new treaty with Rwanda and said he would introduce emergency legislation to assert the country was safe.The legislation is expected to be introduced in Parliament this week.Court concernsMr Cleverly travelled to Kigali and signed the new legally binding treaty alongside Rwanda's foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta on Tuesday.He is the third home secretary to make his way to Rwanda - following in the steps of his predecessors Priti Patel and Suella Braverman.The British government says the new treaty ensures that people relocated to Rwanda are not at risk of being returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.The treaty establishes a new appeal body, which will be made up of judges with asylum expertise from a range of countries, to hear individual cases.The government says Rwanda's asylum system would be monitored by an independent committee, whose powers to enforce the treaty would be beefed up.The Monitoring Committee will develop a system which will enable relocated people and their lawyers to lodge complaints, the government says.At a press conference, Mr Cleverly insisted Rwanda was a safe country and said ""we feel very strongly this treaty addresses all of the issues of their lordships in the Supreme Court"".He said this would be ""reflected in domestic legislation soon"".A spokesperson for the Rwanda's government said it had a ""proven record"" of offering a home to refugees, and the new treaty would ""re-emphasise, in a binding manner, already existing commitments"" on asylum seeker protection.The asylum policy has already cost the UK government at least £140m, but Mr Cleverly said the UK has not paid Rwanda any additional money for the new treaty.The home secretary said he could not see ""any credible reason"" to question Rwanda's ""track record"" of handling asylum cases and he hoped to see the scheme running ""as quickly as possible"".He said Rwanda had a ""strong reputation"" of being humane and was ""uncomfortable"" at the ""tone"" of the criticism levelled at Rwanda.Rwanda's foreign affairs minister suggested ""internal UK politics"" may have played a role in the asylum policy being blocked.But Mr Biruta said: ""I would say there's always room for improvement to any system designed by human beings, Rwandan or British.""This is the reason why we have worked on this treaty... to make sure we can improve our asylum system and that we have a fair and transparent asylum system in place.""Tory disquietConservative MPs on the right of their party are putting pressure on Mr Sunak to stop migrant boat crossings.More than 45,700 people crossed the Channel to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.In the coming days, the government will bring forward new legislation to try to avoid more legal challenges to its Rwanda plan.The One Nation Caucus of Conservative MPs have expressed concerns about the legislation and fear it may seek to ignore UK and international human rights laws.Some Tory MPs argue that withdrawing the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty, would stop the Rwanda scheme from being blocked by legal challenges.But senior Tory MP Damian Green said Conservatives like him ""hold these treaties dear and they should be seen as fundamental to part of protecting the UK's democratic legacy"".The UK government is also facing calls to slash net migration, which has soared to a record 745,000 in 2022.The Conservatives have repeatedly promised to cut net migration since winning power in 2010, and ""take back control"" of the UK's borders following the Brexit vote.On Monday, the home secretary announced a package of measures including raising the minimum salary needed for skilled overseas workers from £26,200 to £38,700.Mr Cleverly claimed 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK last year would not be able to in future.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulTougher visa rules unveiled in plan to cut migrationJames CleverlyRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67627696"

""Immigration policy must be fair, legal, and sustainable.""The migration plan comes after official figures last month showed net migration had soared to a record 745,000 in 2022.Conservative MPs have since piled pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government to bring down net migration, which is the difference between those entering and leaving the UK.Legal migration is too high, says Rishi SunakJenrick pressures No 10 with plan to cut migrationBrexit means buck stops with government on immigrationWhat is the government's new immigration policy?The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since winning power in 2010, and ""take back control"" of the UK's borders since the Brexit vote.The party's 2019 election manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000 when he was prime minister.Immigration is shaping up to be a key issue ahead of the next general election, which is expected in 2024.With Labour leading in opinion polls, Mr Sunak has vowed to ""do what is necessary"" to bring down net migration.Writing in the Sun newspaper, the prime minister wrote: ""If you can't contribute to the UK, you are not coming to the UK. ""Our plan will deliver the biggest-ever cut in net migration and curb abuse."" On top of the new salary requirements, the government said it would:Ban care workers bringing family dependants to the UKEnd companies being able to pay workers 20% less than the going rate for jobs on a shortage occupation listIncrease the annual charge foreign workers pay to use the NHS from £624 to £1,035Raise the minimum income for family visas to £38,700, from £18,600 from next springAsk the government's migration adviser to review the graduate visa route to ""prevent abuse""The home secretary told MPs the changes would take effect in the spring next year.""In total, this package, plus our reduction in students dependants, will mean around 300,000 fewer people will come in future years than have come to the UK last year,"" Mr Cleverly told MPs.The figure of 300,000 is an estimate, based on internal Home Office calculations.The Home Office believes the previously announced ban on most overseas students bringing dependents with them will account for almost half of the overall reduction.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Monday's announcement was ""an admission of years of Tory failure on both the immigration system and the economy"".She said while net migration ""should come down"", the Conservatives were ""failing to introduce more substantial reforms that link immigration to training and fair pay requirements in the UK, meaning many sectors will continue to see rising numbers of work visas because of skills shortages"".Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said the ""cruel plans spell total disaster for the NHS and social care"".""Migrant workers were encouraged to come here because both sectors are critically short of staff. Hospitals and care homes simply couldn't function without them,"" she said.The plans were welcomed by some Conservative MPs, with former cabinet minister Simon Clarke calling the changes ""serious"" and ""credible"" steps.But Mr Cleverly's predecessor as home secretary, Suella Braverman, was less impressed.She said the package was ""too late and the government can go further"" on salary requirements and ""shortening the graduate route"".Mrs Braverman claimed she had put forward similar proposals six times when she was home secretary ""but the delay has reduced their impact"".She has lambasted the government's record on immigration since she was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak last month.Staffing concernsThe latest statistics show the challenge ministers will face in reducing migration into the health sector, which has come to rely heavily on hiring workers from abroad.The government said in the year ending September 2023, 101,000 visas were issued to care workers.An estimated 120,000 visas were granted to the family dependants of those care workers, the government said.The care sector is facing staffing shortages and providers have resisted curbs on their ability to hire foreign workers.The government's migration advisers have previously said ""persistent underfunding"" of local councils, which funds most adult social care, is the most important factor in the staffing crisis. Mr Cleverly acknowledged some care workers might be deterred from coming to the UK because they would not be able to bring families under the new rules.But he said he believed there would still be care workers who would be willing to work in the UK.Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory, said the decision to raise the family income threshold to £38,700 was ""the biggest surprise of the day"".The government's changes to the minimum income for family visas mean that people may be blocked from bringing their relatives to stay in the UK under certain circumstances.""Family migration makes up a small share of the total, but those who are affected by it can be affected very significantly,"" Dr Sumption said.""The largest impacts will fall on lower-income British citizens, and particularly women and younger people who tend to earn lower wages.""Are you affected by the decision to raise the salary threshold?

"9 March 2023","Gary Lineker says he will 'keep speaking for those with no voice' after asylum row","Gary Lineker says he will 'keep speaking for those with no voice' after asylum row9 March 2023ShareJemma Crew & Sean SeddonBBC NewsShareAFPGary Lineker has said he will try to keep speaking up for people with ""no voice"", after criticism of his tweets on the government's asylum policy.The Match of the Day host had said the language setting out the plan was ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"".Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she was disappointed by the remarks. The BBC said it was having a ""frank conversation"" with Lineker about the BBC's need to remain impartial.On Tuesday, the government outlined its plans to  ban people arriving in the UK illegally from ever claiming asylum, in a bid to address a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats.Opposition MPs and humanitarian organisations have strongly criticised the proposals to detain and swiftly remove adults regardless of their asylum claim - but the PM and home secretary have defended the plan, saying stopping the crossings is a priority for the British people.The presenter described it on Twitter as an ""immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"".His remarks were criticised widely by Conservative MPs and ministers, including Ms Braverman and Downing Street.The furore surrounding Lineker's latest remarks puts pressure on the BBC, with director general Tim Davie having made impartiality a cornerstone of his leadership.Why Lineker's comments present problem for the BBCResponding to some of the criticism on Wednesday, Lineker tweeted: ""Great to see the freedom of speech champions out in force this morning demanding silence from those with whom they disagree."" He followed up shortly after with: ""I have never known such love and support in my life than I'm getting this morning (England World Cup goals aside, possibly). I want to thank each and every one of you. It means a lot. ""I'll continue to try and speak up for those poor souls that have no voice.""Earlier, Ms Braverman told BBC One's Breakfast she was ""disappointed, obviously"" in his comments.""I think it's unhelpful to compare our measures, which are lawful, proportionate and - indeed - compassionate, to 1930s Germany. ""I also think that we are on the side of the British people here.""0:45Watch: Suella Braverman says she is ""disappointed"" by Gary Lineker's tweetDowning Street later said Lineker's criticism of the new asylum policy was ""not acceptable"".The prime minister's press secretary told reporters: ""It's obviously disappointing to see someone whose salary is funded by hard-working British (licence fee) payers using that kind of rhetoric and seemingly dismissing their legitimate concerns that they have about small boats crossings and illegal migration.""But beyond that, they added, ""it's up to the BBC"" and they would not comment further.A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said comparisons with Germany in the 1930s ""aren't always the best way to make"" an argument.Lineker, who has presented Match of the Day since 1999, is the BBC's highest paid star, having earned about £1.35m in 2020-21.He has in the past been vocal about migrants' rights and has taken refugees into his home. He has also been critical of successive Conservative governments over issues including Brexit. In October, the BBC's complaints unit found Lineker had broken impartiality rules in a tweet asking whether the Conservative Party planned to ""hand back their donations from Russian donors"".The comment came after the then Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Mr Davie said in 2020 he was prepared to sack people to protect the BBC's reputation for impartiality.He issued new social media guidelines and said he was willing to ""take people off Twitter"" - a comment which Lineker responded to at the time by saying ""I think only Twitter can take people off Twitter"".The presenter's frequent outspoken online posts have been viewed by some as a test of the BBC's ability to balance its impartiality duty with its ability to attract top talent in the era of social media.Earlier on Wednesday, when asked about how many ""strikes"" the presenter has had over social media posts, Mr Davie said he wasn't going to speak specifically about individuals.He added: ""I think the BBC absolutely puts the highest value on impartiality and that's clearly important to us.""In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Lineker indicated he had no intention of retracting his comment or steering clear of politics outside of his work for the BBC.Richard Sambrook, the BBC's former director of global news, said the controversy highlighted the need for the broadcaster to clarify how impartiality rules apply to its sport staff and freelancers.He told Radio 4's PM programme similar cases would ""corrode trust"" in the BBC unless the position was made clearer. The Lineker row also comes amid scrutiny of the circumstances surrounding the appointment of BBC chairman Richard Sharp and his relationship with Boris Johnson.A committee of MPs said last month Mr Sharp had committed ""significant errors of judgement"" by not disclosing his involvement in the then-prime minister's financial affairs while seeking the senior BBC post. Mr Sharp insists he got the job on merit.  The broadcaster's editorial guidelines state the organisation is ""committed to achieving due impartiality in all its output"" and that ""public comments, for example on social media, of staff [or] presenters... can affect perceptions of the BBC's impartiality"".Lineker criticised for voicing political viewsThe row over the Migration Bill is just beginning Will this migrant bill become a reality?A spokesperson for the corporation said: ""The BBC has social media guidance, which is published. ""Individuals who work for us are aware of their responsibilities relating to social media. ""We have appropriate internal processes in place if required.""We would expect Gary to be spoken to and reminded of his responsibilities.""The corporation has also responded to previous criticism of Lineker by highlighting that he is not involved in its news or political output and is a freelance broadcaster, not a member of staff.

"14 August 2023","Ministers face renewed pressure over boat crossings","Ministers face renewed pressure over boat crossings14 August 2023ShareAndre Rhoden-Paul, Bethany Bell & Lisa Louisin London and CalaisShareReutersMinisters are facing renewed pressure to tackle boat crossings in the Channel after six migrants died when a vessel sank off the French coast on Saturday.Labour said people smugglers were ""running rings"" around the government, and a Tory backbencher said the UK had a ""moral duty, both to our own citizens and... asylum seekers, to act"".The government has made ""stopping the boats"" one of its five priorities.Investigations continue into the incident which saw 59 people rescued.The overloaded vessel, which got into difficulty and capsized 12 miles (20km) off Sangatte, was said to be one of a number of migrant vessels which set off in the hope of reaching the UK.The incident happened in French waters at about 04:00 local time, with British and French teams working together to rescue the migrants.  The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan with some Sudanese.More than 100,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the Channel in small boats in the last five years. and more than 500 arrived on Saturday.A new law, the Illegal Migration Act, is central to the government's plans to stop small boats crossing the Channel. It aims to deter people from making such journeys by detaining and removing those who do.But plans to do this by sending some of them to Rwanda, to claim asylum there, is still subject to legal challenge. Shadow cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast: ""The events in the Channel are absolutely tragic.... and demonstrate why we need much tougher action to crack down on criminal gangs that are exploiting people, putting them in harms' way"".She said saying convictions had fallen for people smugglers under the current government and accused ministers of presiding over a Home Office which was ""increasingly shambolic and completely incompetent"".Ms Phillipson added a ""better, fairer system"" was needed to address a backlog of asylum applications ""that is completely out of control"". How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Channel migrant crossings pass 100,000 since 2018How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Calls for action have also come from within the Conservative Party. Backbench MP and ex-party chairman Sir Jake Berry said ""only radical changes can truly turn the tide"".Writing in the Sunday Express, he called for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, which he claimed would continue to block ""any and all attempts to stop the boats"".Refugee charity Care4Calais said the incident was an ""appalling and preventable tragedy"", while the Refugee Council warned ""more people will die"" unless more safe routes to the UK are created.Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who chaired a meeting with UK Border Force officials on Saturday, said the deaths were a ""tragic loss of life"".Conservative minister David TC Davies says the government has already stopped ""a lot"" of boats and insisted the controversial Rwanda policy was a solution. He said it would ""take away the incentive to jump into rickety boats"".A government spokesman said Labour was ""cynically using the deaths"" to make ""cheap political points"".Labour was not offering any solutions, they said, while the government was ""determined to break the people smuggling gangs' business model and save people's lives"".The government has also struck an agreement with France, under which the UK will pay £500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. A Home Office spokesperson said the Nationality and Borders Act, which came into effect in April 2022, was ""beginning to have an impact on the exploitative business model of people smugglers"", with more than 650 people arrested.French authorities have in the past pointed to the English Channel's long coast line as making it extremely difficult for the coastguard to prevent all small boat crossings.On Saturday, 509 people made the journey across the Channel to the UK, government figures show, bringing this year's total to 16,679. The English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day. French authorities said the migrant boat was first detected by a commercial vessel, before a French patrol boat was dispatched to the boat in distress.French sea minister Hervé Berville said: ""While we mourn these victims... it is the responsibility of human traffickers - of criminals - who send young people, women, adults, to their death on these maritime routes that are dangerous and lethal.""Investigators are looking for any information that might lead them to the smuggling gang which organised the crossing.Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing. The pressure on the ministers follows criticism after 39 asylum seekers had to be moved off the Bibby Stockholm barge moored off the Dorset coast because of the discovery of Legionella bacteria in the water supply.Six dead after migrant boat sinks in ChannelChannel migrant crossings pass 100,000 since 2018UK immigrationFranceHome OfficeEnglish ChannelImmigrationEurope migrant crisisCalais","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66490218"
"28 May 2023","Home Office starts ad campaign to deter Albanian migrants","Home Office starts ad campaign to deter Albanian migrants28 May 2023ShareJasmine AnderssonBBC NewsShareGetty ImagesThe government would not say how much the publicity drive is expected to cost.The Home Office is launching an ad campaign targeting Albanian nationals to deter them from migrating to the UK.The adverts, which will run in Albanian on Facebook and Instagram, will warn that people will ""face being detained and removed"" if they make the journey.The government said the campaign, starting next week, would ""make clear the perils"" migrants on small boats face.Labour said the move ""beggars belief"", and the asylum system was ""in chaos"".According to the Home Office, Albania is a ""safe and prosperous country"" and many nationals ""are travelling through multiple countries to make the journey to the UK"" before making ""spurious asylum claims when they arrive"".The campaign follows a similar social media drive launched by the government in August last year. Home OfficeThis is one of the adverts the Home Office has ran targeting people considering entering the UK without permissionImmigration minister Robert Jenrick said the campaign would ""work proactively at the source before people set off on dangerous and unnecessary journeys"".Albania was the most common nationality applying for asylum in the UK in the year to March 2023, with 13,714 applications by Albanian citizens.Between January and March, 1% of small-boat arrivals were from Albania.Mr Jenrick said: ""We are determined to stop the boats and the campaign, launching in Albania this week, is just one component of the Home Office's work upstream to help dispel myths about illegal travel to the UK, explain the realities and combat the lies peddled by evil people-smugglers who profit from this vile trade.""The government would not say how much the publicity drive is expected to cost.Getty ImagesLast year Albanians demonstrated in central London following comments from the government, calling it 'the language of hatred'Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action, called the campaign ""pointless"" and said it ""repeats the myth that refugee migration is illegal"".He said: ""This is yet another pointless campaign that shows ministers refuse to understand that a small minority of the world's refugees have very powerful reasons to come here.""If the Government wanted to smash the smuggling gangs and stop people crossing the Channel in flimsy boats it would create more safe routes for refugees to travel here to claim asylum.""Chief executive of refugee charity Care4Calais Steve Smith said ""no amount of taxpayer-funded PR spin"" will deter refugees ""from seeking a safe future"".""Refugees have experienced some of the worst things imaginable from war and conflict to torture and human rights abuses. ""The only solution that will put people smugglers out of business, stop small boat crossings and save lives is to offer safe passage to refugees with a viable asylum claim in the UK.""Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""It beggars belief that as Channel crossings continue to rise and the asylum system is in chaos, all the Conservatives can come up with to stop the criminal gangs is an ad campaign.""At every turn, the Tories so-called solutions fail to meet the scale of the crisis. All they are doing is tinkering at the edges.""The campaign follows the government's Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to send asylum seekers who arrive in Britain via unauthorised routes back home or to a third country such as Rwanda.Ministers also hope the legislation will cut the daily £5.5m cost of housing migrants who make it to the UK.The Bill, currently in the House of Lords, has faced backlash from public figures and campaigners including the Archbishop of Canterbury, who argue that it is both unworkable and ""morally unacceptable"".Albanian prisoners given money to leave UKDozens of child migrants go missing from careHome OfficeImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersAlbaniaMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-65735660"
"27 September 2023","UN refugee agency rejects Suella Braverman asylum comments","UN refugee agency rejects Suella Braverman asylum comments27 September 2023ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterShare1:25Braverman: Allowing people to claim asylum after travelling through safe countries is ""absurd and unsustainable""Home Secretary Suella Braverman is facing criticism after she said the international asylum system was no longer fit for purpose. In a speech earlier, Mrs Braverman said fearing discrimination for being gay or a woman should not be enough to qualify for refugee protection. But the United Nations' refugee agency (UNHCR) rejected her calls for the rules to be ""tightened"". It said the 1951 Refugee Convention ""remains a life-saving instrument"". The convention forms the basis of the UNHCR's work and provides an agreed definition of a refugee and minimum standards for their treatment. In a statement following Mrs Braverman's speech, the UNHCR said: ""The need is not for reform, or more restrictive interpretation, but for stronger and more consistent application of the convention and its underlying principle of responsibility-sharing.""The agency added: ""Where individuals are at risk of persecution on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, it is crucial that they are able to seek safety and protection.""It argued an ""appropriate response"" to the growing numbers seeking asylum in the UK and the backlog of claims would be speeding up decision-making processes. Charities also criticised the home secretary's comments, with ActionAid UK describing them as ""a direct affront to gender equality and human rights"". Where it's illegal to be gayHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Government committed to Rwanda plan, Braverman saysThe Refugee Convention was drawn up following World War Two, and has at its centre the principle that refugees should not be returned to countries where they face threats to their life or freedom.However, addressing a US think tank on Tuesday, Mrs Braverman said ""we now live in a completely different time"" from when the convention was signed.She told an audience at the right-wing American Enterprise Institute in Washington DC that developing case law had seen a move away from helping those fleeing persecution ""in favour of something more akin to a definition of 'discrimination'"". The home secretary acknowledged there were ""vast swathes of the world where it is extremely difficult to be gay, or to be a woman"". ""Where individuals are being persecuted, it is right that we offer sanctuary,"" she said.""But we will not be able to sustain an asylum system if in effect, simply being gay, or a woman, and fearful of discrimination in your country of origin is sufficient to qualify for protection.""There are 64 countries that have laws that criminalise homosexuality, nearly half of which are in Africa.PA MediaGiven that much of the world is signed up to the existing convention it is unlikely Ms Braverman will manage to drive through reforms.But her comments highlight the government's determination to take a tough approach on migration as it seeks to stop people crossing the Channel to the UK in small boats. Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of human rights charity Amnesty International UK, said: ""The Refugee Convention is a cornerstone of the international legal system and we need to call out this assault on the convention for what it is: a display of cynicism and xenophobia.""Labour said Mrs Braverman was ""grandstanding"" and using gay people and women as ""scapegoats"".There has also been a backlash from some in Mrs Braverman's own party.Andrew Boff, a long-serving Conservative member on the London Assembly and patron of the LGBT+ Tories, accused her of ""dog whistles"" and ""victim-blaming"" to distract from ""the appalling backlog of asylum claims"". One Tory MP, who did not want to be named, told the BBC they thought the speech was ""awful"" and that unless the prime minister ""gets rid"" of Mrs Braverman there was a danger it ""reflects poorly on him"". Downing Street said it had signed off the home secretary's speech.Other Conservatives were more supportive, with Tim Loughton, a Conservative member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, saying Mrs Braverman ""had a point"".""The UK cannot be the refugee camp for the entire world and that's why we need to look at exactly how these international agreements can work in the 2020s,"" he told the BBC.What is the Refugee Convention?The convention was drawn up in 1951 and came into force three years later, during an era where millions were displaced across Europe after World War TwoIt was originally drafted to focus specifically on Europe's post-war refugees - but a 1967 amendment removed the geographic and time limits included in the original text and made the convention universalThe convention provides an agreed definition of a refugee, establishes basic minimum standards for their treatment, and says that refugees should not be penalised for breaching immigration rules while fleeingIts core principle is ""non-refoulement"" - which means refugees should not be returned or expelled from a country against their will if they fear for their life or freedomAlmost 150 countries have signed up to the ConventionMrs Braverman also used her speech to attack ""a misguided dogma of multiculturalism"".""Multiculturalism makes no demands of the incomer to integrate,"" she said adding: ""It has failed because it allowed people to come to our society and live parallel lives in it.""And, in extreme cases, they could pursue lives aimed at undermining the stability and threatening the security of society.""The home secretary said her parents - who migrated to the UK from Mauritius and Kenya - ""both signed up to British values wholeheartedly"".Mrs Braverman's decision to visit Washington and make such a punchy speech will inevitably be seen through the lens of her own leadership ambitions.She ran unsuccessfully for the Conservative leadership last summer and is a likely candidate to stand again should Rishi Sunak lose the next general election.Analysis In 2022, there were 1,334 asylum applications lodged in the UK, where sexual orientation was part of the basis for the claim. This represents 1.5% of 74,751 asylum claims made last year.The top countries of origin were Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria. In all three countries consensual same-sex sexual acts are illegal. They are punishable by life imprisonment and, in some parts of northern Nigeria, by death (according to The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association)However, sexual orientation may not be the only grounds on which the asylum applications were made. Also, we do not know whether sexual orientation influenced the outcome of the claims.Suella BravermanRefugees and asylum seekers","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66930930"
"25 March 2024","Say one thing, do another? The government’s record rise in net migration","Say one thing, do another? The government’s record rise in net migration25 March 2024ShareRos AtkinsBBC PanoramaSharePA MediaThink back to the 2019 election campaign. Quite reasonably, you may not remember every detail of the Conservatives' manifesto - but perhaps you do recall one promise: to reduce immigration. Think back further, to 2016 and the Brexit referendum. Then there was a promise to ""take back control"" of the UK immigration system. And since it left the EU in 2020, the UK does have more control.But the numbers of people who've moved here didn't go down, they went up. Since the Brexit vote and the Conservatives' victory in 2019, the 12 months to June 2022 saw the fastest population growth since the 1960s. Current projections from the Office for National Statistics put the UK on course for 74 million people by 2036 - six million more than there are today. You'd be well within your rights to ask how that could be? The answer, according to the ONS, is largely immigration. And one aspect of immigration has received huge amounts of attention from the government and the media. Statement after statement, story after story, has focused on migrants crossing the Channel in small boats - and the government's efforts to stop them. Indeed you'd be forgiven for thinking small boats are a major part of why immigration is up. But they aren't.No doubt, small boats are an important issue - on a human and national level. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five priorities. His government's flagship Rwanda plan aims to send some asylum seekers who arrive on small boats there - and Mr Sunak is still trying to get the bill through parliament.But it's not small boats that are driving an increase in immigration - it's choices made by the government.PA MediaAlmost 30,000 people arrived in the UK on small boats last year - something the prime minister has vowed to crack down onThere are a number of ways to measure immigration. Let's start with one: net migration. That's the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the UK each year.In 2022, it's estimated to have reached an all-time record of 745,000.Then, there's the number of visas issued to people relocating to the UK.  Last year there were more than 1.4 million.For context, last year almost 30,000 people arrived by small boat.After the UK left the European Union, the government launched a new visa scheme for most people who don't have a UK passport. The government decides the criteria for the different visas it issues - these can be for studying, for working, for humanitarian reasons - and other purposes too. In the words of Prof Brian Bell, who chairs the government's independent Migration Advisory Committee, the rise in immigration is ""the inevitable consequence of government policy"".We can see how this is the case by breaking down that 1.4 million figure.In 2022, the government issued almost 300,000 humanitarian visas. But last year the number was 102,000 - that's just 7% of the 1.4 million visas issued. The government has been consistent in its response when asked about the record levels of net migration. Tom Pursglove MP, the Legal Migration Minister, told me: ""We've seen incredible generosity in our country to people from Ukraine, people from Afghanistan, people from Syria, and other conflict zones. That is an important part of why we've seen the figures as they are.""It is important, no doubt. And there was political consensus that issuing visas to people from Hong Kong, Ukraine and elsewhere was the right thing to do. But the numbers show that this isn't the full story. The government has made other choices that have pushed up immigration.Care home owner Raj Sehgal had struggled to fill roles at his five care homes in NorfolkBrexit and the pandemic added to existing recruitment problems in the social care sector. Care home owners responded by asking the government to make it easier to employ overseas care workers.Those calls were echoed by the Migration Advisory Committee, which also suggested the government should fund higher wages to attract more British workers into the sector. The Westminster government agreed more visas could be issued but did not raise wages.A number of consequences followed. For care home owners like Raj Sehgal, the changes helped. He filled almost all vacancies in his five Norfolk care homes, with 40% of staff coming from abroad.""If we didn't have international recruitment, I think we would probably be closed by now,"" he told me.More overseas staff arrived to work across the sector. But more may be needed. Last year, there were around 150,000 vacancies in England, and recruiting British workers remains difficult.Let's look at that 1.4 million figure again. Of all of those visas, more than 146,000 went to health and social care workers, another 203,000 went to their dependants.This month, the government stopped overseas care workers from bringing dependants, describing the numbers as ""disproportionate"". Mr Sehgal says this has already reduced the number of applications he is receiving. This seems certain to reduce net migration numbers, but it's not certain how the care sector will find the staff it needs. Panorama - Immigration: The UK's Record RiseRos Atkins explores how net migration to the UK has hit record levels, when the government promised in the wake of Brexit that immigration would be lower.Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 18 March (20:30 in Wales)If the government's decisions on social care have driven up immigration, then so have its decisions on overseas students. First of all, let's consider the context here. Tuition fees for domestic undergraduates at English universities are capped at £9,250 a year. That hasn't risen for seven years - but during the same period, costs have. That has left universities facing financial challenges.Some of them, like Coventry University, have targeted higher-paying overseas students to help cross-subsidise UK undergraduates. Forty per cent of the students at its campuses across the UK are from overseas.If domestic tuition fees were raised, it could reduce the need for overseas students. But that would cost a lot. And it hasn't happened.Prof Brian Bell argues ""that's a choice of the government not to fund education in a particular way. The inevitable consequence is more immigration.""The government couldn't have been clearer about its ambition to attract more overseas students. In 2019, it even set a target to increase the UK's overseas student population to 600,000 - by 2030. It achieved that goal nine years early.On top of that, in 2021, the government reintroduced a post-study work visa which allows overseas postgraduate students to work for two years after their courses finish - or three years if studying for a PhD.It took the decision despite the Migration Advisory Committee suggesting that it shouldn't.All of this did what it was designed to do - attract lots more students. Last year the government issued almost 458,000 sponsored study visas. And almost 144,000 for dependants of postgraduate students.Together, they made up almost 42% of the more than 1.4 million visas issued last year.Again, the government was choosing immigration.Now at this point, we should emphasise that while the government was putting in place policies that promoted immigration, knowing their precise impact was hard. Dr Madeleine Sumption leads the Oxford Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. She also sits on the Migration Advisory Committee that advises the government.Predicting immigration numbers is ""incredibly difficult"", Dr Sumption says. ""Sometimes it's much larger than the government expects.""As the consequences of the government's own policies became clear, it slammed on the brakes. In May last year it announced that, from January 2024, most overseas postgraduate students would no longer be able to bring dependants.This March, the government took further action - it ordered a review of the visa that allows overseas students to stay on and work. This, let's remember, is the scheme the government had introduced only three years ago.Legal Migration Minister Tom Pursglove explains: ""The government took a view that we thought that that was the right thing to do to support the university sector. But when you consider the dependant numbers that have come with students, that has been very, very challenging.""The government's measures appear to be making a difference already. According to Universities UK, some universities are seeing a sharp drop in applications from overseas students for postgraduate courses.But there's a risk that as applications go down, so does the income of some universities. TOLGA AKMEN/EPAA British Future poll suggests 69% of respondents are dissatisfied with the government on immigrationAll of these government decisions have contributed to the record rise in net migration, and along with the rise we're also seeing a shift in public opinion.The think tank British Future, which tracks UK attitudes to immigration and describes itself as non-partisan, has shared its latest opinion poll with Panorama.For the first time in four years, the poll suggests a majority of 3,000 respondents - 52% - want overall immigration to fall.On top of that, 69% of those polled say they are dissatisfied with the government on immigration - that's the highest since its polling began in 2015.And this is where we come back to where we started - to the government's emphasis on the issue of small boats. The opinion poll also suggests that a little over half of those who say they are dissatisfied with the government's handling of immigration pointed to small boats - and those concerns are coinciding with concerns about overall immigration. Dr Sumption told me the media's focus on small boats has probably created the impression that almost all migration comes that way, ""which obviously it doesn't"".To reiterate - almost 30,000 people came by small boats last year and 1.4 million visas were issued by the government for people to come to the UK legally.Some argue that the government has overemphasised the issue of small boats. When I put that to Tom Pursglove, he countered that the government has a ""moral imperative"" to ""grip that issue"". But he said that shouldn't stop them, ""delivering on the mission around legal migration, which is to get a better balance to bring those numbers down"".Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman was sacked in November 2023At the moment, by the prime minister's admission, that balance is off. In November, Rishi Sunak acknowledged, ""immigration is too high and needs to come down"".But his former Home Secretary Suella Braverman made a series of striking claims when I talked to her about Mr Sunak's approach. ""I think the prime minister has not necessarily assumed that it's an important issue for the British people,"" Ms Braverman says. ""'I struggled myself as home secretary, even to have a meaningful conversation with him about it. I was left to written correspondence on several occasions throughout a period of 12 months, putting forward policy proposals. But he refused to talk to me.""I was taken aback by this. I know there is little political love lost since Mr Sunak sacked Ms Braverman last year - but this is the home secretary during the time of one of the sharpest rises in net migration in the UK's history - claiming the prime minister wouldn't talk to her about it - at all - for a year. I double-checked I had heard right. I had.""We talked about the boats every week, twice a week. We talked to each other a lot about policing and security. On legal migration, I was unable to get a hearing with the prime minister for 12 months.""Given the importance of this issue to so many people, it is an extraordinary claim.When we asked No 10 about this, it did not comment. At the end of last year, the government announced plans to cut net migration by reducing the number of people coming to the UK by 300,000.  Remember, the latest estimate for net migration is 672,000 for the year to June 2023.The estimate published just before the Brexit referendum - and which, at the time, Boris Johnson called ""scandalous"" - was 333,000. That estimate has now been revised down to 303,000.So if the government meets its new target, that would take the numbers back towards where they were… just before the Brexit vote.PA MediaThe government emphasises that Brexit has given the UK greater control and flexibility to adapt immigration policy to circumstanceSome observers watching the government's statements and actions on immigration are gently raising their eyebrows. Prof Anand Menon, who leads the independent think-tank UK in a Changing Europe, told us: ""I think there is an element of dishonesty in the government at one and the same time implementing these policies and bemoaning them. Or bemoaning their impact.""There seems little doubt the government's latest measures will make a difference. Net migration is expected to fall. But if it does, the longer-term challenges that immigration has been easing may come into sharper focus.Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which says it operates on a ""non-political basis"", has an uncompromising message on this.""If you want universities to have as much money as they have at the moment without these foreign students, you need to find some money from British students or the British taxpayer. If you want care homes to be staffed without bringing people in from elsewhere, you're going to have to pay more. You have to make choices here.""I'd hoped to ask Labour some questions about how it would approach these choices, but it declined.This month, the Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said, ""We are very clear that net migration needs to come down"" and that a practical plan to tackle skills shortages in the UK is needed.But are politicians of all parties being straight with us about what these choices involve?  For this government, for any government, these choices will involve difficult and sometimes expensive trade-offs. Legal Migration Minister Tom Pursglove argues ""issues have arisen"" and it has ""responded to those issues"". It emphasises that Brexit has given the UK greater control and flexibility to adapt immigration policy to circumstance. Others point to recent data showing that one in five working-age adults are off work in the long-term, with record numbers recorded with long-term sickness.In the Spring Budget, the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said it would be easy to fill the 900,000 job vacancies with higher migration, but with 10 million adults not in work, it would be ""economically and morally wrong"".It's inescapable though, that while the UK now has more control of its immigration system, the government has used that control to allow more people to come to the UK.To come back to the question I posed earlier: how did that happen?We can answer that by listing the government's decisions and by acknowledging that there are powerful long-term factors that appear to encourage higher immigration. Our population is ageing, our birth rate is falling and our economy is struggling to grow. The government though still insists the numbers will and must come down. However, despite all the promises, this government chose more immigration. It is unlikely to be the last to do so.

Ms Braverman has been criticised for overcrowding at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, which has reportedly led to outbreaks of disease and violence.The prime minister's official spokesman said Rishi Sunak told his cabinet at a meeting on Tuesday that the UK would ""always be a compassionate, welcoming country"".Earlier, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC politicians must be careful with their language when talking about this issue.Charities criticised the use of the word ""invasion"", with the Refugee Council saying the language was ""appalling, wrong and dangerous"". 1:57Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick: ""We have to grip this (migration) challenge""Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale, who represents North Thanet, where the Manston centre is located, said using such ""inflammatory language"" was ""completely unacceptable"" and ""might well incite an unpleasant element in British society to violence"".He told the BBC's Newshour programme Ms Braverman's insistence that she had not blocked the use of hotels to ease overcrowding at Manston was ""disingenuous"" and the problem was made ""right at the top of the Home Office"". He claimed Ms Braverman's predecessors as home secretary had commissioned alternative accommodation but she had not, leading to a ""log jam"". Asked if this was a generous way of saying Ms Braverman was not telling the truth, he replied: ""Yes.""Other Conservative MPs supported Ms Braverman, with Brendan Clarke-Smith saying she was ""right"", adding that ""we must stop people abusing our system, rather than making excuses for them"".2:26Suella Braverman: ""There are some people who would prefer to be rid of me... let them try""Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit Party and UKIP, said in a Twitter video Ms Braverman was right to use the word ""invasion"" and she had ""the guts to say many of these people are just not refugees"". Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""No home secretary who was serious about public safety or national security would use highly inflammatory language on the day after a dangerous petrol bomb attack on a Dover initial processing centre.""The SNP said Ms Braverman's ""incendiary language makes a mockery of [prime minister] Rishi Sunak's claims about so-called compassionate conservatism"".At one point over the weekend some 4,000 people were being held at the former RAF base at Manston, which is only designed to accommodate 1,600 people on a temporary basis.Hundreds of people were moved there on Sunday after a man threw firebombs at a separate immigration centre in Dover. The home secretary told Tuesday's cabinet meeting the Dover centre had now reopened and large numbers were being taken from Manston to other accommodation. A report from a visit by the chief inspector of prisons in July found Manston had considerably improved but still identified issues such as no access to fresh air or exercise and a lack of beds, with people sleeping on rubber mats on the floor. Since then, chief inspector Charlie Taylor said the situation had ""significantly deteriorated"". People are only supposed to be kept at Manston for 24 hours for security and identity checks, before being moved into the Home Office's asylum accommodation system, which often means a hotel.When the chief inspector of immigration visited last week, he found some people had been there for over a month. That included one family who had been there for 32 days, sleeping on mats in a marquee.Migrants rest at an unnamed Home Office facility in KentIn pictures sent to the BBC, the walls in the facility are covered in writingAt another unnamed Home Office facility, in Kent, young people sleep on the floor on padded mats with only a thin blanket for warmth.

But ex-Home Secretary Sajid Javid said his successor was doing all she could.He also questioned why people were making the dangerous journey, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""You have to ask the question, if you are a genuine asylum seeker, why have you not claimed asylum already if you're in a safe country [like France]?""What happens to migrants who reach the UK?Minister to lead review into migrant crossingsOnly five Channel migrants returned to EU in 2021The government has launched a review into how to prevent boats from crossing the 21-mile stretch of water from Calais, with the now-Health Secretary Mr Javid saying it wanted to ""bust the business model"" of people smugglers, who were ""ultimately responsible"" for the problem. But Tory MPs are warning the issue is costing the Conservative Party in the polls.Speaking to the BBC, South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay said it had become a key issue on the doorstep and a solution was needed ""now"". A government source told the BBC the home secretary was the only one who had come up with a credible plan.But they acknowledged there was no ""silver bullet"" to solve the issue. Record numbers of people have made the crossing this year, with more than 1,000 making the journey in a single day earlier this month.Home Secretary Ms Patel has promised tougher action, but the numbers have continued to rise.And it is understood Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants more to be done. The UK signed a deal with France in July, pledging €62.7m (£54m) during 2021-22 to help the country increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.But Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds accused his government counterpart of being ""more interested in a diplomatic spat [with France] than she is in a workable deal"". Ministers have often talked tough on small boats crossing the Channel - but record numbers are making the dangerous journey and potentially risking their lives.Some Tory MPs believe the government is increasingly looking weak by not managing to stop illegal crossings. They report significant concern among constituents and believe that is being reflected in opinion polls.For a party that promised to take back control after Brexit, they argue this shows the opposite. Labour wants closer cooperation with France - accusing ministers of indulging in ""spats"". But it's not clear that would solve the issue either. Ministers argue the Nationality and Borders Bill going through the Commons at the moment will give them more powers, such as to process asylum cases in another country. The argument is this would deter those people who are not genuine asylum seekers. But it will be some time before ministers get those powers - and there are growing calls for a more immediate answer.  The shadow home secretary said his party would reintroduce the Dubs scheme - intended to offer safe passage to unaccompanied child asylum seekers - as well as increasing patrols further away from the coast and reinstating overseas aid funding.He also said a Labour government would find a replacement for the Dublin agreement, which allows EU countries to transfer asylum seekers back to the first member state they were proven to have entered - an agreement the UK left after Brexit.Between January 2019 and October 2020, 231 migrants who crossed the Channel were returned to mainland Europe using the Dublin agreement.But Immigration Minister Tom Pursglove told MPs last week that only five had been returned to mainland Europe so far in 2021.Mr Thomas-Symonds told Andrew Marr: ""There are thousands of lives being risked in the English Channel on a day-to-day basis and the home secretary's incompetence on this matter is dangerous.""But Mr Javid said leaving the Dublin agreement had made little difference to the UK's ability to send asylum seekers back to other countries. Sajid Javid: ''The pandemic has made returning people across the world, across asylum systems, much harder''""Hardly any country in Europe enforced the Dublin agreement,"" the health secretary said.""I can tell you that because I was home secretary at the time trying to enforce it and almost every country in Europe ignored it.""The minister said new agreements were needed with the EU, but he said Ms Patel had already signed some with countries like India.He added: ""I would say that the pandemic has made returning people across the world, across asylum systems, much harder, and we do have to take that into account as well.""Mr Javid also said the home secretary ""is doing everything that she can and she hasn't taken anything off the table"" to tackle the issue.

Mrs May, who has previously spoken in the Commons about her concerns, added: ""So it's making sure that, in dealing with problems that are identified, we don't create other problems.""Mr Sunak has denied he would water down the definition of modern slavery and said he wanted to stop the system ""being clogged up by people making spurious claims"".

They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail.Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. From the City to the cabinetAfter university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations.""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong.""His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career.A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s, he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon.They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's.According to a ConservativeHome profile, Mr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 07:00 so they could get front-row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech.Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress.He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary.PASajid Javid (third from left) with the 2014 Budget teamDid Mr Javid vote for Brexit in the referendum?Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then-Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.)He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round before Mr Johnson went on to become prime minister.Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout from the Windrush scandal.At the time, Mr Javid told the Sunday Telegraph the scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me.""In 2019 he took a hardline stance towards Shamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. PAMr Javid talking to Tata Steel workers in 2016In his previous cabinet roles he avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretary over Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to the Grenfell disaster. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government.

"23 December 2022","A year of one political crisis after another","A year of one political crisis after another23 December 2022ShareGlenn CampbellPolitical editor, BBC ScotlandShareGetty ImagesLiz Truss was Britain's shortest-serving prime ministerThree prime ministers. Two heads of state. One crisis after another. That, in short, is the story of 2022. There was also a UK Supreme Court ruling that cancelled plans for an independence referendum next October. In Scotland, we started the year in Covid-19 restrictions and ended it with a huge NHS backlog and long waits for treatment.The full costs of curbing public services and economic activity during the pandemic are still being counted. The public inquiry that might do some of that work stalled with the resignation of its chairwoman, the judge Lady Poole. As the Covid-19 emergency eased, the war in Ukraine fuelled an energy price spike and wider cost of living pressures. Thousands of Ukrainian refugees fled to Scotland, with many temporarily housed on ships in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Ukrainian refugee Mariana Zdzhanske travelled to Edinburgh with her mother, who has dementiaThe UK government has been at the forefront of efforts to arm and train the Ukrainian military. It has also borrowed billions of pounds to reduce the impact of rising gas and electricity bills on household budgets. As chancellor, Rishi Sunak announced a support package the day after Sue Gray's report into lockdown parties in Downing Street. That gave Boris Johnson only temporary respite from the scandal that did so much to undermine his premiership. It caused a huge rift with the bulk of the Scottish Conservative group at Holyrood and their leader, Douglas Ross. He demanded the PM's resignation in January only to suspend that call when Russia invaded Ukraine the following month. Getty ImagesMr Ross wrote to the 1922 committee calling for a leadership contest after saying Mr Johnson's position was untenableHis flip-flop and Partygate itself did the Scottish Tories no favours in the local elections where they slipped into third place behind Labour. The SNP got the most votes and seats in what was their 11th successive victory in a Scotland-wide election. They remain the dominant force in Scottish politics after more than 15 years in power. Boris Johnson survived a confidence vote of Tory MPs only to be forced out by mass resignations from his government. Having led that rebellion, Rishi Sunak lost out to Liz Truss in the leadership contest that followed. She travelled to Balmoral to be appointed prime minister by the Queen two days before Her Majesty's death. Large crowds lined the streets of Scotland to pay their respects to a monarch who Ms Truss said had been ""devoted to the union"". Getty ImagesNicola Sturgeon paid tribute to the Queen and welcomed King Charles to the throneAt Holyrood, Nicola Sturgeon described the Queen as the ""anchor of our nation"" as she welcomed King Charles to the throne. Within weeks, Liz Truss had destroyed her premiership with a disastrous tax-cutting mini-budget that spooked the markets. She became the Britain's shortest-serving prime minister in the same year that Nicola Sturgeon outlasted all previous first ministers of Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon: The story so farNot that everything went Ms Sturgeon's way this year. She couldn't celebrate her longest-serving moment because she got Covid-19. There have been pay strikes by teachers, rail workers and bin collectors, with NHS staff due to walk out in the new year. The vastly overdue, overbudget ferries from the Ferguson shipyard continue to erode the Scottish government's reputation for competence. And controversial reforms to make it easer to legally change gender prompted the biggest ever SNP rebellion at Holyrood. PA MediaOpponents of the gender recognition reforms protested outside the Scottish parliamentMeanwhile, the party's MPs at Westminster forced out the first minister's ally, Ian Blackford, as their leader. That came after the UK Supreme Court ruled that Holyrood cannot hold another independence referendum without Westminster's approval. That indefinitely delays indyref2, except that Nicola Sturgeon intends to treat the next UK election as if it were a vote on independence. The detailed approach to this massive political gamble is to be decided at a special conference in the spring. The SNP are heartened by a short run of opinion polls that suggest 'Yes' is currently ahead. Further tumultIn the same way, Labour are encouraged by the UK polling trend that suggests they are on course to take power from the Conservatives. The party is promising to redistribute power throughout the UK, not least as an alternative to Scottish independence. It is Rishi Sunak's challenge to turn around his party's fortunes, as the third Tory PM this year - the fifth since the Brexit vote. That's easier said than done when inflation is sky high, interest rates and taxes are rising and public spending is to be squeezed. The UK's financial challenges are reflected in Scotland, where ministers decided to put a penny on income tax for higher earners. They are maintaining a new £25 a week child payment to help poorer families. In challenging times, further tumult is inevitable, although it's hard to imagine the year ahead being anything like as eventful as 2022.The judgement is clear but not what Sturgeon wantedWhy we should worry about what is happening in A&EThe Ukrainians living on a cruise ship in EdinburghDrunken No 10 party culture laid bare in reportDossier suggests ferry deal may have been riggedHow bad is the gender reform rebellion for the SNP?Scottish government loses indyref2 court caseFerriesBoris JohnsonLiz TrussRishi SunakScottish Budget","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-64064282"

The peer, the UK's first South Asian cabinet minister, claimed the home secretary's comments on small boats and grooming gangs ""emboldened racists"". She told the BBC she feared a backlash against British Asians and had told her dad not to walk home from the mosque.Ms Braverman's spokesperson said she would ""not shy away from hard truths"". Ahead of announcing plans for a new police taskforce to tackle grooming gangs, Ms Braverman said groups of ""vulnerable white English girls"" were being ""pursued and raped and drugged and harmed by gangs of British Pakistani men who've worked in child abuse networks"".'Inflammatory and divisive'Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - who jointly launched the taskforce with Ms Braverman - said victims and whistleblowers had often been ignored by the authorities because of ""cultural sensitivity and political correctness"".In an interview on Sky TV's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the home secretary said grooming gangs had a ""predominance"" of ""British Pakistani males, who hold cultural values totally at odds with British values"".Ms Braverman said police and council workers had ""turned a blind eye to these signs of abuse out of political correctness and out of fear of being called racist"" - referencing findings in several reports into grooming in Rochdale, Rotherham and Telford.Political correctness aiding grooming gangs - PMWhat do we know about grooming gangs' ethnicity?In a series of joint letters to the prime minister, a coalition of groups including senior medics and the British Pakistan Foundation called on Ms Braverman to withdraw her comments, which some labelled as ""inflammatory and divisive"".Baroness Warsi, who chaired the Conservative Party between 2010 and 2012, backed the letters, adding that the home secretary's comments had left vulnerable British Asians fearful of attacks.""I've had to warn my son that if people start swearing and shouting, to just remove himself from the situation to avoid it escalating into an attack. Why should I be having these conversations with my son?,"" she told BBC News.""I've had to tell my dad if you go to the mosque don't walk home, we need to have someone taking him and bringing him back every day.""Getty ImagesSayeeda Warsi was a Conservative Party chairwoman between 2010 and 2012She said Ms Braverman ""was tarnishing a whole community"" by focusing on British Pakistanis, who were a ""small subset"" of perpetrators in a context of half a million children a year being sexually abused. ""If you look at the interviews she did, she gave no caveats,"" Baroness Warsi added.""Ms Braverman basically said group sexual exploitation is a British Pakistani problem. At no point in those interviews did she say it was a small minority of British Pakistanis committing these crimes.""A 2020 Home Office study found offenders in child grooming gangs ""are most commonly white"", based on data from just under half of all police forces.'Shock jock'The same report found ""a number"" of high-profile cases had ""mainly involved men of Pakistani ethnicity"", but also highlighted ""significant limitations to what can be said about links between ethnicity and this form of offending"".In 2012, while serving in David Cameron's cabinet, Baroness Warsi said a ""small minority"" of British Pakistani men believe ""white girls are fair game"" for sexual abuse.Her comments followed revelations that a child grooming gang of mostly Pakistani men preyed on girls under the age of 16 in Rochdale.Referencing her former comments, Baroness Warsi said: ""I am the last person to say don't have bold and brave conservations with local communities - but they need to be based in fact.""Suella Braverman needs to understand that when she opens her mouth she's speaking as a home secretary. She can't use loose language.""This kind of 'shock jock' language is becoming a pattern with her. It feels like she more interested in the rhetoric and the noise of creating a culture war than the actual job.""Writing in the Guardian, Baroness Warsi added: ""Whether this consistent use of racist rhetoric is strategy or incompetence, however, doesn't matter. Both show she is not fit to hold high office.""How many people cross the Channel in small boats?A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The Home Secretary has been clear that all despicable child abusers must be brought to justice.""And she will not shy away from telling hard truths, particularly when it comes to the grooming of young women and girls in Britain's towns who have been failed by authorities over decades.""As the Home Secretary has said, the vast majority of British-Pakistanis are law-abiding, upstanding citizens but independent reports were unequivocal that in towns like Rochdale, Rotherham and Telford cultural sensitivities have meant thousands of young girls were abused under the noses of councils and police. ""That's why we have announced a raft of measures, including a new police taskforce and mandatory reporting, to ensure this horrific scandal can never happen again, and bring members of grooming gangs to justice for the victims.""Ms Braverman's comments were supported in a joint statement from UK Sikh and Hindu faith groups. The letter praised Ms Braverman, for ""courageously speaking out about the over representation of British Pakistani men in sex grooming gangs"".The letter, signed by crossbench peer Lord Singh of Wimbledon, said it was ""false to label all Pakistani Muslim men as groomers"" but politicians should not ""allow political correctness to stifle obtaining justice for victims by addressing the actions of a minority"".Small boat numbers Baroness Warsi also criticised Ms Braverman's claims that ""100 million people"" around the world could qualify for protection under current UK asylum laws - and that ""they are coming here"".This refers to people forcibly displaced around the world as recorded by the UN's refugee agency. There is nothing to suggest they would all want to come to the UK.The Home Office said Ms Braverman meant that illegal migrants were coming to the UK - pointing out that there had been a 500% increase in small boat crossings in two years.Small boat arrivals accounted for about 45% of asylum applications made in 2022.What do we know about grooming gangs' ethnicity?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Suella BravermanBaroness WarsiRacism","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65249872"

The measure is part of attempts to address an increase in the number of people arriving in the UK via Channel crossings each year, which rose from around 300 in 2018 to more than 45,000 in 2022. Responding to a video message setting out the policy by Ms Braverman, Lineker tweeted: ""Good heavens, this is beyond awful.""Told by another user he was ""out of order"", he added: ""We take far fewer refugees than other major European countries. ""This is just an immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s, and I'm out of order?""It is not clear which language in particular Lineker was referring to, but Ms Braverman's video and accompanying tweet included the words ""enough is enough"" and ""we must stop the boats"". 0:45Watch: Suella Braverman says she is ""disappointed"" by Gary Lineker's tweetFollowing the comments, the home secretary told BBC One's Breakfast: ""I'm disappointed, obviously.

He has also been critical of successive Conservative governments over issues including Brexit. In October, the BBC's complaints unit found Lineker had broken impartiality rules in a tweet asking whether the Conservative Party planned to ""hand back their donations from Russian donors"".The comment came after the then Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged Premier League teams to boycott the Champions League final in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine.

Just over 1.2 million people came to the UK expecting to stay at least a year, and about 532,000 departed. That is a fall from 2022's record net migration figure, which has been revised upwards to 764,000.However, the ONS said it was ""too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend"".Of the 1,218,000 who came to the UK in 2023, 10% (126,000) were EU nationals. This is similar to the 2022 total of 116,000. About 85% (1,031,000) came from outside the EU. The top five non-EU nationalities were: Indian - 250,000Nigerian - 141,000Chinese - 90,000Pakistani - 83,000Zimbabwean - 36,000The ONS says approximately 62,000 more Pakistani nationals, 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals came to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019.The number of people coming to the UK for humanitarian reasons in 2023 - including from Ukraine and Hong Kong - was 50,000, compared to 160,000 in 2022. How are the minimum salary rules for UK visa applicants changing?Most people wanting to work in the UK still have to apply for a visa through the points-based system (PBS).But since 11 April 2024, they have needed a job offer with a higher salary.Applicants have to earn at least £38,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous £26,200 minimum.The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales. But overseas care workers can no longer bring family dependants with them. Announcing the new rules, Home Secretary James Cleverly claimed300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK in 2022 would no longer qualify.At the time, groups including the CBI and the Royal College of Nursing criticised the government for failing to address the UK's labour shortages.Say one thing, do another?

Mr Sunak said the higher threshold would be reached ""in early 2025"".Anyone renewing an existing family visa will not have to meet the new earnings threshold, the Home Office has confirmed.Home Office rows back on salary threshold for family visaVisa salary rules will keep us apart, mum warnsPA MediaAre fewer people coming to work in health and social care?Home Office data showed the number of people coming to the UK to work in health and social care has fallen to its lowest monthly level for more than two years.It said 2,200 health and care worker visas and 6,400 visas for their dependents were granted in April.The total number of visas granted during the first four months of the year showed a 76% fall compared with the same period in 2023.The number of dependents' visas for care workers dropped by 6% over the same period.How does the points-based system work?Applicants need 70 points to qualify for a skilled worker visa.You get 50 points from having a job offer above a minimum skill level, and speaking English.The remaining 20 points can come from a higher salary, working in a sector with job shortages, or having a relevant PhD.The standard fee for a skilled visa is usually between £719 and £1,500. Visa applicants also have to pay a healthcare surcharge for each year of their stay.The amount can vary - but since April 2024, the standard fee has been £1,035 per year, up from £624. What is the immigration salary list?The immigration salary list has replaced what was previously called the shortage occupation list. It helps employers fill vacancies in key sectors. These jobs have a lower salary threshold, making it easier for applicants to gain enough points to get a visa.The list includes:health and care workerspharmacistsgraphic designerssome farming and fishing rolesconstruction workersvetsGetty ImagesA wide range of construction jobs are on the listEmployers used to be able to pay foreign workers 80% of the usual ""going rate"" to fill these positions. But this rule has been abolished for people applying after 4 April 2024. What are the rules for student and graduate visas?In the 12 months to the end of March 2024, the government issued almost 450,000 study visas, 6% fewer than the previous year.Of these, 116,000 were issued to Indian nationals, and 109,000 to Chinese nationals.Those on postgraduate courses could also apply for visas for qualifying dependants: a husband, wife, civil or unmarried partner and children under 18. In the year to March 2024, 111,000 visas were issued to student dependants, a fall of 25%.Since January 2024, international postgraduate students have not been able bring dependants unless their course is a research programme.Between January and April 2024, Home Office data shows only 8,300 student dependent visas were issued - a fall of 79%.Students who have already completed their degree can stay in the UK for two years - three years for those with a doctoral degree - to work under a graduate visa.In the year to the end of March 2024, 35,000 such visas were issued, excluding dependants, a 38% drop. What about seasonal workers?Temporary workers such as fruit pickers and poultry workers are covered by seasonal worker visas.For 2023 and 2024 there are between 45,000 and 55,000 seasonal worker visas available, plus another 2,000 for poultry workers.Getty ImagesAn application costs £298.Workers must be paid the relevant national minimum wage.'It used to be easy to get fruit pickers'How has Brexit changed immigration?Before Brexit, EU and UK citizens had the freedom to live, work or study in any EU country without needing a visa.However, this freedom of movement ended on 1 January 2021 when the UK left the EU. In the 12 months to June 2023, net EU migration was -86,000, meaning more EU nationals left the UK than arrived.Net migration of non-EU nationals - the difference between those arriving and those leaving - was 768,000.Net migration of British nationals was -10,000, meaning more British people left the UK than came back.

Sir Keir Starmer has said he would aim to negotiate a returns agreement with EU countries to send back some failed asylum seekers if Labour wins power. Government ministers claim the policy would lead to 100,000 illegal migrants a year being shipped to the UK.But this was rejected as ""garbage"" by Labour's shadow home secretary.On Thursday, Sir Keir suggested he may be willing to accept a quota of migrants in the UK in exchange for a returns deal, as he set out plans to crack down on international people smuggling gangs.Starmer seeks new EU deal to stop small boats gangsHighest number of migrants cross Channel in 2023How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?This was seized on by the Conservatives as evidence Labour would pursue an ""open border"" migration policy if it won power.Home Office minister Chris Philp told Times Radio: ""I think his policy has no credibility and the British public don't want to see 100,000 of Europe's illegal immigrants being shipped over here under Keir Starmer's open border policy.""Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper rubbished the government's claims in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, arguing that their figures were based on a returns scheme for EU member states.Formally joining the EU quota scheme would not be part of the plan because the UK is not a member state, she said, meaning any agreement would be with individual countries.Ms Cooper told Today: ""We have seen total garbage on this from the Conservatives over the last 24 hours, which just shows how desperate they are that their whole system is failing.""She later explained that Labour's policy would involve ""controlled and managed but safe routes for children who have family in the UK"".Ms Cooper has also been setting out Labour's plans to end the use of hotels, barges and former military bases to house asylum seekers if it wins the next general election.She said Labour would recruit 1,000 new caseworkers to clear the asylum backlog and set up temporary Nightingale Asylum Courts to speed up the decision-making process.Labour is also promising to fast-track decisions on applications from ""safe"" countries, such as Albania and India.The party claims that once the current asylum backlog is clear there will be no need for hotels, barges or former military bases, which Ms Cooper said are costing taxpayers more than £2bn a year.Labour's plans have also come under attack from the left.Matt Wrack, the president of the Trade Union Congress, told the Guardian Sir Keir was in ""danger of pandering to right wing Tory rhetoric"" on immigration.Would the UK take 100,000 migrants a year from the EU under Labour?The Conservatives' claim that Labour would let in 100,000 illegal migrants to the EU every year assumes Sir Keir's party would sign up to taking 13% of all asylum seekers who arrive in the EU.They say this is because the EU has a policy of sharing asylum seekers between countries, based on population size. About one million arrive in the EU each year. The UK's population is just under 13% of the EU's total, so this would mean taking well over 100,000 asylum seekers. However, although the EU has been negotiating for years on how to share responsibility for refugees arriving via the Mediterranean, no deal based on population is in place.In 2015, when refugee numbers peaked in Europe, the UK was still an EU member state, but did not take part in an EU-wide response as it had an opt-out.Labour has now said it would not - and could not - sign up to an EU quota scheme because the UK is not a member state, so any agreement would have to be outside that.

"11 May 2023","Migration bill risks damage to UK's reputation, says Archbishop of Canterbury","Migration bill risks damage to UK's reputation, says Archbishop of Canterbury11 May 2023SharePaul Seddon & Becky MortonBBC NewsShare1:02The Archbishop of Canterbury argues against the Illegal Migration Bill, but Lord Howard backs it.The Archbishop of Canterbury has attacked the government's migration plans, saying they risked ""great damage"" to the UK's reputation.Justin Welby said the Illegal Migration Bill would not stop small boat crossings, and it failed in ""our moral responsibility"" towards refugees.He was speaking as the bill began what is expected to be a rocky passage through the House of Lords.But Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick urged peers to back the legislation.Adding that the archbishop was ""wrong"" in his criticism, he said: ""There is nothing moral about allowing the pernicious trade of people smugglers to continue.""I want to see that stopped, and this bill is the only way to do that,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.He added that critics of the bill, including opposition parties, had not suggested ""any viable alternatives"" to stop journeys across the Channel.The archbishop's pointed intervention came during a lengthy, highly charged debate about the bill in the Lords on Wednesday.The legislation cleared its first parliamentary hurdle in the Lords after a Liberal Democrat bid to block it was rejected by 179 votes to 76.The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?UK's Rwanda asylum plan ungodly, says ArchbishopThe bill, unveiled in March, is a key part of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's plan to ""stop"" small boats crossing the English Channel - which he has made a priority ahead of the next general election.It will place a legal duty on the home secretary to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, to Rwanda or another ""safe"" third country.This has prompted outrage from opposition parties and charities, which argue the bill is unworkable and could breach international law.'Short-term fix'The archbishop, one of nearly 90 peers who have put their names down to speak in the debate, told the Lords the bill ""fails utterly"" to take long-term view of the migration challenges around the world.Although he conceded existing international law was in need of updating, he said the bill represented a ""dramatic departure"" from existing conventions and would undermine international co-operation on the issue.Describing the bill as a ""short-term fix,"" he said it ""risks great damage to the UK's interests and reputation, at home and abroad"".He added it was ""morally unacceptable and politically impractical"" for the UK to let the poorest countries deal with asylum seekers when the UK is cutting its international aid spending.Baroness Helic, a former adviser to William Hague when he was foreign secretary, described the government's plans to stop small boats as ""a race to the bottom"".The baroness, who fled to the UK from war-torn Bosnia at the age of 23, argued the Illegal Migration Bill represented ""an outright ban on asylum"" and questioned its morality.But other peers spoke for the bill, including Conservative Lord Forsyth, who said he was ""yet to hear"" a solution to stop boat crossings from critics of the bill.He congratulated the archbishop for his ""fantastic job"" at the Coronation on Saturday, but added that while he agreed with him on spiritual matters, they disagreed on the bill.He said he agreed it needed further scrutiny, but it was ""not reasonable to criticise the government for trying to deal with this problem"".The government made a series of concessions to different sections of the Conservative Party to ease its passage through the Commons last month.However, senior peers have told the BBC they expect significant opposition in the Lords - where the government does not have a majority. Although peers did not vote on amendments during the debate, it was their first chance to have a say on the bill.Lib Dem peer Lord Paddick put forward a rare ""motion to decline"" that would have blocked the bill from continuing in the Lords, forcing the government to reintroduce it from scratch in the Commons. But the motion was heavily defeated in the Lords, with peers rejecting it by 179 votes to 76, majority 103.Lord Paddick said: ""This Bill is all pain and no gain. This is a question of principle.""Labour peer Lord Coaker said that although his party was against the bill, the Lib Dem motion was not the best way to oppose it.He said Labour would do ""all we can"" to change the bill at a later stage, vowing that the party would not be ""cowed"" into accepting the verdict of the Commons.Modern slavery concernsSeveral peers have already spoken out against changes giving ministers more leeway to ignore attempts by European judges to halt deportations of migrants from the UK. The government has also faced strong criticism from senior Tories, including former Prime Minister Theresa May and former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, over the potential impact of the bill on victims of modern slavery. The bill would take away temporary protections against removal from the UK that are currently offered to suspected victims of modern slavery or human trafficking while their case is considered. Critics say this could deter victims from going to the police. There has also been concern, including among Conservative MPs, over new powers in the bill to detain children on the suspicion that they are liable for removal.Ministers have agreed to work with Tory MPs on a time limit for how long unaccompanied children can be detained. To get the bill through the Commons, ministers also promised to set out new safe and legal routes for asylum seekers, after pressure from backbenchers.

"14 December 2022","Chris Mason: Asylum backlog is complex issue to resolve","Chris Mason: Asylum backlog is complex issue to resolve14 December 2022ShareChris MasonPolitical editor, BBC News•@ChrisMasonBBCShareGetty ImagesFor as long as Rishi Sunak has been prime minister, whenever I've spoken to him or his senior team, the issue of small boat crossings has often been mentioned.Before the Autumn Statement, the budget in all but name last month, I was told the prime minister was devoting more time to it than anything else but the statement. Quite something, given the range of issues that cross a prime minister's desk.The government is desperate to get a grip on what Home Secretary Suella Braverman has said has been a failure to control the UK's borders. They want to cut the numbers crossing the Channel in small boats.They want to deport asylum seekers whose claims are rejected much more quickly.And they want to house asylum seekers whose cases are being worked on more cheaply.Why? Because they have concluded it's a big deal for millions of people, and, having candidly pointed out the failure of Conservative governments over the last 12 years to sort it out, or even adequately manage it, they now need to show they are up for it. Sunak's migration plan raises big questions What's behind the Home Office migrant backlog?Let's be blunt: this is an incredibly difficult and complex issue to resolve, whatever resolution even means on this. Take a look at this from more than 20 years ago, when Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett was promising a crackdown, including making the asylum process quicker. Two decades later, Mr Sunak is promising exactly the same. How the issue presents itself varies.Back then it was about the Red Cross refugee camp at Sangatte near Calais and migrants trying to cross by climbing into the back of lorries or get through the Channel Tunnel.Now, it is small boats and a particular influx from Albania.In a world where you're only a smartphone scroll away from knowing how rich some places are compared to home, let alone if you're also fleeing persecution, the lure of a country like the UK will always be there.But let's unpack what the prime minister is promising.Firstly, that issue that has dogged successive governments: making the asylum process quicker.Mr Sunak said ""we expect to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year"". But when he said ""abolish the backlog"" he didn't mean all of the backlog.Downing Street later acknowledged this meant making an initial decision in all cases that were outstanding at the end of June this year, when the system for processing cases was changed.What happened at the end of June was the Nationality and Borders Act became law.Since then it has been an offence to arrive on the shores of the UK without permission and so officials are now able to differentiate claims depending on whether people arrived through legal or illegal routes. What ministers are actually committing to is clearing the backlog of 92,601 initial asylum decisions relating to cases made in June of this year or earlier.As of September this year, there were around 117,000 unresolved asylum cases awaiting a decision, relating to around 143,000 people (a case can relate to more than one person because of families).So that is around 24,000 cases that could still be unresolved in a year's time, on top of additional cases between now and then, that wouldn't count against the prime minister's definition of abolishing the backlog.And as he acknowledged to me when I interviewed him, reaching an initial decision is often not the end of the matter, because people can appeal ""and we're not in control of the pace of those appeals"". Mr Sunak is also promising a new law ""to make unambiguously clear that if you enter the UK illegally you should not be able to remain here"". But what isn't clear is whether he would contemplate the UK leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, or be willing to ignore any adverse rulings from its court.And one other thing in the package of ideas that caught my eye: the government's promise to cut in half the current cost of housing asylum seekers, often currently in hotels.The current approach currently runs up a bill of £5.5m a day.Instead, Mr Sunak wants people to be housed in disused military facilities, old holiday parks and former student digs.But when I asked him where, he couldn't tell me, saying I wouldn't expect him ""to comment on commercial negotiations"".  I wouldn't - but if such negotiations are still ongoing, it's not nailed down that the necessary alternative accommodation will be available.And that's before the huge political rows about the sites that are chosen, when there is a very good chance of strong local opposition.So what about Labour's approach to all this, as they seek to present themselves as an alternative government?Leader Sir Keir Starmer pointed to what he sees as persistent Tory failure on the issue, as well as what he called the ""unworkable gimmicks"" that ministers have suggested and remain committed to, such as deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda.But his response was notably short and he himself will want to appear robust on the issue, given how much it matters to so many people, particularly in seats Labour needs to win back to form a government.This prime minister and his successors, whoever they are, will continue to wrestle with asylum and illegal immigration.It's a challenge history suggests governments can only ever hope to manage, rather than solve.PM pledges more staff to help clear asylum backlogSunak's migration plan raises big questionsWhat's behind the migrant backlog?Home OfficeImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63966778"

"5 March 2024","Rwanda bill: Government suffers five defeats in House of Lords","Rwanda bill: Government suffers five defeats in House of Lords5 March 2024SharePaul SeddonPolitics reporterShareGetty ImagesThe bill is a key part of the PM's plan to ""stop"" small boats crossing the English ChannelThe government has suffered five defeats in the House of Lords over its bill to revive its proposed Rwanda deportation scheme.The legislation would deem Rwanda a safe country to send asylum seekers to, in a bid to stop removals being derailed by appeals.But peers backed changes to make it easier for judges to challenge this. They also said the treaty underpinning deportations must be ""fully implemented"" before flights take off.The bill will continue its passage through the Lords on Wednesday, when opposition peers could inflict further defeats.However, the government is likely to overturn these when it returns to the Commons - likely later this month.The bill is a key part of the government's plan to ""stop"" small boats crossing the English Channel, which Rishi Sunak has made a priority for his premiership. Ministers want flights to Rwanda to begin this spring. UK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum dealWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda bill begins tricky Lords stageMinisters unveiled the draft law late last year, after its scheme to send an unspecified number of asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.In a attempt to resurrect the scheme and prevent legal challenges blocking future deportations, it would say Rwanda is a safe country in UK law and restrict the ability of the courts to block them on human rights grounds.The government argues this is a necessary step to ensure deportations are not derailed by legal challenges.But critics, including some Conservatives, say it will put people at risk and also undermine the independence of the courts.In a series of votes earlier, opposition peers backed an amendment that would enable courts to overrule the presumption Rwanda is safe, if they see ""credible evidence to the contrary"".The amendment, proposed by crossbench peer Lord Anderson of Ipswich, was also supported by a handful of Conservatives, including former home secretary Lord Clarke of Nottingham.Lord Anderson added: ""If Rwanda is safe as the government would have us declare, it has nothing to fear from such scrutiny"".Peers also approved changes that would mean Rwanda could only be deemed safe when independent officials overseeing the UK's deportation treaty with the country say it has been ""fully implemented"".They also backed a Labour amendment that specifies the bill must maintain ""full compliance with domestic and international law"".'Merry-go-round' of challengesThe government says its new treaty with Rwanda, signed in December, addresses the Supreme Court's objections.Home Office Minister Lord Sharpe of Epsom said the treaty, which replaced an earlier deal, would mean there was no risk of people sent to Rwanda being sent on to their home countries, where they could face persecution. Outlining why he rejected the amendments, he said the legal grounds for challenging deportations should remain ""limited,"" in order to ""prevent the merry-go-round of legal challenges"".""We cannot allow systematic legal challenges to continue to frustrate and delay removals,"" he added.The changes made to the bill will now go back to the Commons, where the government has a majority and is likely to overturn them.If the changes are rejected the bill will then undergo a process known as ""ping pong"", expected later this month, where it would go between MPs and peers until they can agree on the final wording. Labour has suggested its peers will not seek to block the bill's passage into law completely, although Lord Coaker, one of the party's whips, said ministers should ""listen"" to objections raised in the Lords.UK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum dealWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Refugees and asylum seekersRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68473525"
"25 March 2021","Priti Patel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rules","Priti Patel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rules25 March 2021ShareShare1:11Home Secretary Priti Patel says the new rules are based on the principle of fairnessThe home secretary has set out what she has called a ""fair but firm"" overhaul to the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated. Priti Patel said, for the first time, people seeking protection as refugees would have their claim assessed based on how they arrive in the UK. She said ministers would crack down on people smugglers because ""enough is enough"".Labour said the plans lacked compassion and competence.Under the changes, people who arrive in the UK by what the government call illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels.There were 35,099 asylum claims made in the UK during the year ending March 2020, with Iran, Albania and Iraq providing the most applicants.More than 8,000 people crossed the Channel in small boats, with the help of people smugglers. What happens to migrants who reach the UK?UK to consider sending asylum seekers abroadAsylum seekers could be processed on old ferriesSetting out the plans to MPs, Ms Patel said the government would introduce a ""faster and fairer"" system that would ""better support the most vulnerable"". Ms Patel said ""serious organised criminal gangs"" were exploiting people trying to get to the UK, and that it was these same gangs who were also involved in ""serious violent crimes"" in the UK such as trafficking guns and drugs.""Families and young children have lost their lives at sea, in lorries and in shipping containers having put their trust in the hands of criminals,"" she added.""The way to stop these deaths is to stop the trade in people that causes them.""She said the new measures will create ""safe and legal routes"", and that people should be claiming asylum in the EU country in which they first arrive, rather than using it as a springboard to reach the UK.""If you illegally enter the UK via a safe country in which you could have claimed asylum, you are not seeking refuge from imminent peril, as is the intended purpose of the asylum system, but are picking the UK as a preferred destination over others,"" she said. Labour's shadow home secretary says the asylum plans are ""lacking in compassion""She said the system was currently ""clogged up"" with bogus claims and legal wrangles. But human rights lawyers have warned the plans are unlawful because they ignore Britain's international obligations under the Refugee Convention.Labour said the proposals would do ""next to nothing to stop people making dangerous crossings"" or to deal with criminal gangs.There are two enormous legal elephants trumpeting away in the shiny glass atrium of the Home Office that are casting some really significant doubts on whether the home secretary's plan is deliverable.Firstly, can she treat some refugees who have a recognised case for protection differently from others, purely based on how they reached the UK?Under the UN Refugee Convention (which, history fans, the UK government helped write in 1951) states can't penalise people in need who come ""directly"" from their homeland - or anyone who has ""good cause"" to enter a nation illegally. Official sources say Ms Patel's restrictions would be legally possible because asylum seekers are not allowed to go ""shopping"" for the best destination.But even if the restrictions are introduced, and the Home Office wants to send people back to France or elsewhere, how is that going to happen?The UK has no legal agreement with EU nations to take these people back. And that's because we chose to leave it as part of Brexit. The BBC has learnt that the Home Office has not sent any failed asylum seekers back to EU states since the end of the Brexit transition three months ago.The home secretary's plans for asylum rely on striking agreements with other safe countries who would be willing to take people who have passed through their territory on the way to the UK.PA MediaMany people smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boatsLabour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the changes proposed by the government ""risk making the situation even worse for victims of human trafficking as it would make seeking help in the UK even harder"". ""The government policy is defined by a lack of compassion and a lack of competence, the plans risk baking in to the UK system the callousness of this government's approach,"" he said.Responding to Ms Patel's pledges, Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon accused the government of ""seeking to unjustly differentiate between the deserving and undeserving refugee"" by giving protection ""based on how they travel to the UK"".Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said it was ""slightly misleading to say people have a choice between the legal and illegal route"" adding ""for many people the clandestine means will be their only way to get to the UK"".She also said there would be ""complex issues"" about whether other countries would be willing to take back asylum seekers deemed to have arrived in the UK via irregular routes.Asked if any EU states had agreed to take people back, Ms Patel replied that she was currently in discussions with those countries.There was support from Conservative MPs in the Commons, including West Bromwich MP Shaun Bailey who said: ""Just like my constituents, I'm angry at the images that we're seeing of small boats coming into the Channel and the sky-rocketing costs of our asylum system.""The broader issue here is this: our European neighbours need to step up. It's as simple as that.""'Nobody chooses persecution' - criticism of asylum changes from an asylum seekerWhat do the new proposals promise?The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims.The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added.But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said.Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK.  Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children.The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"".Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years. The current maximum is six months.And people smugglers - responsible for shipping many of the 8,500 people who crossed the English Channel in small boats last year - could get life sentences.UK immigrationImmigrationPriti PatelRefugees and asylum seekers","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56500680"

With some controversial legislating ahead, the aftershocks of two heavy by-election defeats for the Tories will reverberate into the coming week, and beyond. First, there will be arrival of the two new MPs, Simon Lightwood (Labour's new Wakefield MP) and Richard Foord (Lib Dem from Tiverton and Honiton) who will take their seats in the Commons with as much theatrical flourish (photo-opportunities and carefully scripted quotes) as their respective parties can muster. So two punches onto painful Tory bruises on Monday. Johnson to lead Tories at next election - ministerWhat's the political mood after by-election dramas?But perhaps more telling will be any impact on the behaviour of Conservative MPs in Commons votes. With the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill coming up on Monday, there will be an early opportunity for the disenchanted to express their angst, perhaps by abstention rather than voting against. This was always going to be a difficult vote for the government but potential rebels may now be emboldened - and it will be interesting to compare the impact of the Wakefield result on Conservative MPs in so-called ""red wall"" seats to that of Tiverton on those in Lib-Dem facing seats.The Tory troops will be watching out for any further resignations to follow the former party chair Oliver Dowden. Some may be dismissable as people who knew they were on their way out, but others - upwardly-mobile ""future of the Party"" types - would be damaging. Some Conservatives want the prime minister to hold an immediate reshuffle and are frustrated that this is impossible while he's out of the country attending international summits. And in particular, they want Mr Dowden to be replaced by someone outside the PM's normal circle - ""not an Etonian, not a millionaire"", one backbencher (not Mr Walker) told me. Names like Esther McVey and Robert Halfon were suggested. European Pressphoto AgencyProtesters demonstrated against moves over the NI Protocol earlier in JuneThis is the background against which the week's parliamentary action will unfold.Monday sees the second reading of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill - the controversial measure which empowers ministers to disapply the Protocol and relevant parts of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement in domestic law, as well as giving them sweeping powers to make new arrangements in its place. It covers removing customs checks on ""green lane"" goods destined to stay in NI rather than being exported into Ireland or through Ireland into the EUWhat is the Northern Ireland Protocol row about?PM to unveil plans to scrap parts of EU Brexit dealIt also allows changes to VAT and excise rates to be applied in Northern Ireland and removes the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the EU in enforcing EU rules and settling disputes over the Protocol, as well as bringing Northern Ireland fully under the UK's new subsidy control regime. The EU is poised to take legal action if the bill is passed, and there is already talk of serious opposition in the Commons and a majority against it in the Lords. There is already talk that the government may have to use the Parliament Act (the rarely used mechanism to over-ride objections in the Lords) to force the bill into law. So watch out for pre-emptive warnings from ministers to their own MPs and to peers. Tuesday sees an Opposition Day debate on a subject (or subjects) to be announced. There's talk that the day had been offered to the SNP and that the offer was then declined. Perhaps this is because the SNP First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, is due to announce her plans for a second Independence Referendum, and her Westminster troops don't want to steal any of her thunder - but any SNP debate would certainly have provided an opportunity for the other parties to make merry over their current internal disarray, over the sexual harassment case involving their former chief whip. There's also a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, to create a new criminal offence of elected representatives making false or misleading statements. More Northern Ireland legislation follows on Wednesday, in the shape of a committee of whole house on the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill - which sets up an Independent Commission for Information Recovery, to investigate into deaths and serious injuries that occurred during the Troubles. Day of reflection for 'deep hurt' of the TroublesBill on legacy issues 'presents an opportunity'It would have power to grant immunity from prosecution to those involved, if they cooperate. That, the bill's critics say, amounts to an amnesty for perpetrators on very easy terms. None of the Northern Ireland parties support the measure and NI Justice Minister Naomi Long told the Northern Ireland Select Committee this week that she did not see any way of amending the bill to make it acceptable to them. Committee Chair Simon Hoare has proposed amendments to beef up the Commission, require parliamentary approval of its members and ensure its remit covers sexual offences. The Alliance Party and the SDLP have joined forces to put down amendments deleting whole sections of the bill and the DUP has a series of amendments aimed at curbing the general immunity powers in the bill. Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Kyle has an amendment to exclude a series of sexual and child sexual offences from the immunity powers.  Keep an eye on the government response to amendments, particularly from their own side; Northern Ireland Minister Connor Burns sounded notably receptive to attempts to reshape the bill, when he wound up the second reading = or initial - debate - I wonder if his secretary of state feels the same? The detailed debate continues on Monday 4 July. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Carol Monaghan, would give asylum seekers permission to work, rather than depend on benefits. Thursday sees two backbench debates: on Iran's nuclear programme and on 50 years of Pride in the UK.Committee corridor highlights include Public Accounts (Monday, 14:00) investigating how effectively the government is tackling air quality breaches, with senior officials at Defra, the Department for Transport and Highways England.European Pressphoto AgencyLiz Truss was on a visit to Turkey last weekEducation (Tuesday, 10:00) questions Annie Hudson, chair of the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel, and the chief executives and children's services directors of Bradford and Solihull Councils on child protection, following the murders of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes and Star Hobson.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss MP is before Foreign Affairs to field questions on everything from Ukraine and the withdrawal from Afghanistan to the Northern Ireland Protocol (Tuesday 11:00).Refugees Minister Lord Harrington is before Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (Wednesday 10:00) fielding questions about the Homes for Ukraine scheme, including delays in criminal records checks for UK hosts and of accounts of Ukrainian refugees being forced into temporary accommodation or becoming homeless. It's a quiet-looking week in the Lords, with the main point of controversy likely to be the second reading of the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill, which seeks to protect students and academics from ""cancel culture"".But keep an eye on Lib Dem Lord Redesdale's short debate on the rising cost of agricultural fertilizer and feed, which highlights one of the issues causing serious discontent in rural areas.

""We believe there is more to do,"" he added.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""shockingly high"" net migration represented ""a failure not just of immigration, but also of asylum and of the economy"".The ONS said the population of England and Wales grew by an estimated 1% in the year to June 2022 - the fastest rate since the baby boom in the 1960s, but this time it was driven by international migration.But it cautioned its estimates could be revised again - and provisional figures to June of this year suggest the rate of net migration may now be slowing.Statisticians said in the year to June net migration fell back to 672,000, after 1.2 million people came to live in the UK for at least a year, and 508,000 left.The vast majority (968,000) arriving were from countries outside the European Union.Students accounted for the largest group of non-EU migrants, also true of last year. But there has been an increase in workers arriving with visas to fill chronic staff shortages in the NHS and social care, the ONS said.Arrivals of people via humanitarian routes have fallen from 19% to 9% over the same period, the ONS said, with most of these made up of Ukrainians and British Nationals (Overseas) arrivals from Hong Kong.They said estimates showed a marked change in immigration since 2021 following Brexit - when free movement for EU nationals ended, the easing of travel restrictions after the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.However, the ONS said it was too early to know whether the latest falling net migration figure was the start of a downward trend, but recent estimates did indicate a slowing of immigration coupled with increasing emigration.With more than a decade of Conservative-led governments promising to reduce numbers, these latest figures represent a political challenge for the prime minister.Back in 2010, David Cameron, former Tory PM now foreign secretary, pledged to get net migration below 100,000 - ""no ifs, no buts"". And the party's 2019 manifesto also committed to bring the rate down, without setting a specific target.Home Secretary James Cleverly said the government remained ""completely committed"" to reducing levels of legal migration while also focusing on ""stopping the boats"", referring to the issue of people making dangerous English Channel crossings in small boats.He said the ONS figures did not show a ""significant increase from last year's figures"" and pointed to ""a number of important and positive changes"" affecting them.""The biggest drivers of immigration to the UK are students and healthcare workers - [they] are testament to both our world-leading university sector and our ability to use our immigration system to prioritise the skills we need,"" he said.He added that he was ""proud"" the UK had welcomed more than half a million people through humanitarian routes, principally from Hong Kong, Ukraine and Afghanistan, over the last decade but said they still needed to reduce numbers by ""eliminating the abuse and exploitation of our visa system by both companies and individuals"".Some Conservative MPs are not convinced by his argument however.The New Conservative group, on the right of the party, called for Rishi Sunak to ""act now"" on the ""do or die"" issue and propose a package of measures to bring down migration.""Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don't believe that such promises can be ignored,"" the group, led by Miriam Cates, Danny Kruger and Sir John Hayes, said in a statement.It is understood the government is considering some new measures, including:Limiting to one the number of relatives that health and social care workers are allowed to bring with themRaising the minimum salary threshold for work visasAnd abolishing the system allowing employers to pay less where there are recognised shortagesDowning Street said any next steps needed to be carefully considered.Labour has criticised the government for the cost of using hotels to house asylum seekers who make up a tiny proportion of overall migration.Home Office figures, also published on Thursday, showed hotel use reached a record high in September - despite a slight fall in the asylum backlog.There were 56,042 people in hotel accommodation, while 58,444 people were in ""dispersed"" accommodation - usually housing provided by the Home Office through private companies.The number of people in hotels rose by 5,500 over three months while the number in housing stayed broadly the same.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the number of asylum seekers in hotels was 10,000 more than when Rishi Sunak promised to end hotel use - and was costing almost £3bn a year.""Once again, the British taxpayer is footing the bill for the Conservatives' chaos,"" she said.The population of England and Wales was estimated to be 60.2 million mid-2022, an increase of around 578,000 - or 1% - since 2021.The ONS's Neil Park said: ""Unlike the baby boom driving population growth in the 1960s, the increases in our latest estimates are predominately being driven by international migration.""He said the picture varied across regions, with growth higher in the north of England than the south, and lowest in London.Prof Brian Bell told the BBC's World At One programme net migration ""is very high in the UK relative to historical trends"", adding: ""But there's probably some indication it's beginning to fall. I wouldn't want to bet my house on it, but I think the indications are that we've reached the peak.""He said the Government should raise the salary thresholds related to the skilled worker route - which have not been increased for a number of years - as a way to reduce net migration.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Two migrants die crossing Channel in small boatLegal migration is too high, says Rishi SunakUK immigrationImmigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67506641"

Campaigning under way It comes as campaigning gets underway for the UK's first July election since 1945, after Mr Sunak's surprise announcement in a rain-soaked Downing Street that he was going to the polls.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said recent announcements on the economy showed now was ""the right moment"" to call the vote, which does legally have to take place until January 2025.The prime minister will be on the campaign trail later, whilst the Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders will also be holding events.Meanwhile, Nigel Farage has confirmed he will not be standing as a candidate for Reform UK, the party he co-founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, ahead of a press conference the party is holding later.Failed asylum seeker given £3,000 to go to RwandaUK immigrationRishi SunakGeneral election 2024 Rwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-69052507"
"14 March 2023","Theresa May says asylum plan won't solve illegal migration issue","Theresa May says asylum plan won't solve illegal migration issue14 March 2023ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterShareUK ParliamentTheresa May was among those to raise concerns about the bill in the CommonsGovernment plans to tackle small boat crossings will not solve the issue of illegal migration, former Prime Minister Theresa May has warned. Under the proposals, modern slavery victims would be ""collateral damage"" and denied support, she told MPs.Several other Tories also called for changes to the Illegal Migration Bill. However it passed its first Commons hurdle, with the home secretary saying it was ""a humane attempt"" to break the incentive for people-smuggling gangs.Suella Braverman said the number of people crossing the Channel had ""overwhelmed our asylum system"" and ""our capacity to help people is not unlimited"". The new legislation, announced last week, aims to stop migrants making the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats - which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak made one of his five key priorities. Under the plans, anyone found to have entered the country illegally would be removed from the UK within 28 days, and also be blocked from returning or claiming British citizenship in future. They would either be returned to their home country, or another ""safe third country"" like Rwanda.The bill passed its second reading in the Commons by 312 votes to 250, with the majority of Tory MPs voting for the plans. No Conservatives voted against, although Mrs May and former ministers Chris Skidmore and Caroline Nokes, who have been publicly critical of the bill, were among those who did not register a vote, according to the Parliament website. Critics say the proposals break international law and they are likely to face opposition in the House of Lords, as well as legal challenges in the courts. How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillDuring a debate on the bill in the Commons, Mrs May told MPs that ""whenever you close a route, the migrants and the people smugglers find another way, and anybody who thinks that this bill will deal with the issue of illegal migration once and for all is wrong"". She raised several concerns about the proposed legislation, including that anyone fleeing persecution who came to the UK via an illegal route would face a ""blanket dismissal"". ""By definition, someone fleeing for their life will more often than not be unable to access a legal route,"" she said. Mrs May also highlighted the potential impact of the bill on victims of modern slavery, saying ""as it currently stands we are shutting the door on victims while being trafficked into slavery here in the UK"". ""If they come here illegally they will not be supported to escape their slavery,"" she added. The former home secretary said No 10 had offered to discuss her concerns about the bill and she hoped ""we can find some resolution"". PA MediaHundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square to protest against the bill as it was debated in the CommonsAnother senior Conservative MP, Sir Robert Buckland, said he had ""great concern"" about a clause of the bill which could allow children to be detained. The former justice secretary also warned that the ""tone"" used by some members of his party was ""not appropriate"" and ""we have to do better"". While he said he would vote for the bill, Tory MP Simon Hoare said he wanted to see changes in relation to women who are trafficked and children. Other Tories, including Mr Skidmore, said they could not support the bill. The former minister wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prepared to break international law or the human rights conventions that the UK has had a proud history of playing a leading role in establishing.""And Ms Nokes, the Conservative chairwoman of the Commons women and equalities committee, said she had ""absolute horror"" at the prospect of the bill. ""I am deeply troubled at the prospect of a policy which seeks to criminalise children, pregnant women, families and remove them to Rwanda,"" the former immigration minister told Times Radio. However, other Conservative MPs were supportive of the government's approach. Former minister Sir John Hayes said people wanted ""tough action"" on illegal immigration.""Of course Britain should provide a safe haven for people in need, in genuine need,"" he said. ""But it is a deceit to pretend the asylum system is not being gamed and the British people taken for a ride.""Marco Longhi, who represents Dudley North, said the bill would act as a deterrent for people undertaking ""very perilous journeys"". Labour voted against the bill, describing it as ""a con that makes the chaos worse"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said ""it won't stop the criminal gangs or dangerous crossings"" but ""it will rip up our long-standing commitment to international law"", as well as ""lock up children"" and ""remove support and safe refuges from women who have been trafficked"". The SNP also opposed the bill, saying there was no proof it would work and it would ""create an underclass of people stuck in immigration limbo indefinitely"". Defending the plans, Ms Braverman said unaccompanied children would only be removed from the UK under limited circumstances, such as for the purposes of family reunion. ""Otherwise, they will be provided with the necessary support in the UK until they reach 18,"" she told MPs.Responding to concerns about families and pregnant women, she said ""we must not create incentives for the smugglers to focus on people with particular characteristics by signposting exemptions for removal"". Closing the debate, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said the government was ""committed to tackling the heinous crime of modern slavery and supporting victims"". ""It's for that reason that we want to prevent abuse [of the system],"" he added.

It is, he claims, ""a fundamental change in the global equation on migration.""He is seeking to set this UK argument - as long-winded and controversial as it has been, and continues to be - against a broad generational and geographical backdrop.The idea that the UK's challenge isn't unique, but shared by similar countries wrestling with the pressures of migration.What we have had over the last 24 hours is Rishi Sunak publicly assembling the architecture of action: the additional detention spaces, the extra caseworkers, more capacity for the courts to deal with the issue.But all the noise in Parliament, all the noise in the courts, all the ministerial trips to the Rwandan capital Kigali are a means to an end.The big question now is: how quickly can the government put some asylum seekers on flights?

But they passionately believe a novel approach, a different approach has to be worth a try, because frankly little else has worked.And here is one certainty: whether the Rwanda policy succeeds or fails, lasts or gets dropped, the biggest questions about global migration are not going away.This government and their successors, of every party, will wrestle with these issues for decades to come.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Hope Hostel in Rwanda says it's ready for first migrants from UKWhy a plane to Rwanda won’t be taking off anytime soonUK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68880167"

Rishi Sunak promised in December to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023.The home secretary told MPs the target would not be met at the current pace.But she said she wasn't ""pessimistic"" about the target because more staff would be hired later this year. Mr Sunak, who has listed ""stopping the boats"" as one of his priorities in office, announced last year that the ""legacy"" backlog of asylum cases dating before 28 June 2022 would be abolished by the end of the year.Parliament is currently debating the government's second major piece of immigration legislation since small boat crossings began in 2018.If the Illegal Migration Bill becomes law it will block asylum claims from migrants arriving in small boats, although it is likely to face a challenge under human rights law.Migration Bill 'breaches' human rights obligationsTwo new barges to house migrants announcedIllegal migrants plan could cost £6bn over two yearsAsylum claims - a legal request for sanctuary, or refugee status, in another country - can be made by anyone who comes to the UK under an international convention agreed in 1951. The ""legacy"" asylum backlog total stands at stands at 78,954 cases relating to 104,049 people, according to the latest Home Office data. This means that officials need to make 8,773 decisions every month to fulfil Mr Sunak's pledge. The Home Office is making around 3,600 asylum decisions a month at present, based on the total of 10,750 decisions in the first quarter of 2023.Ms Braverman told MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Committee: ""If you maintained the current pace we wouldn't meet the target. However that's to overlook we will have our full cohort of decision makers later this year. They will be trained up and fully proficient.""At the start of May, there were 1,280 Home Office staff working on asylum decision making, a big increase on a year previously, although a slight fall from the number employed at the start of 2023. The committee also heard from a senior Home Office official, Dan Hobbs, who confirmed that the proportion of asylum decision makers who leave their jobs each year stood at 28%.The government has also introduced a streamlined process for asylum claims from nationals of five countries with the highest asylum acceptance rates.Questioned by MPs, Ms Braverman also conceded conceded that women trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation could be deported under new measures to tackle illegal migration.The home secretary said women could receive protection if there was ""compelling evidence for their reasonable grounds"" or if ""they are part of a police investigation"".She was also asked by the SNP's Alison Thewliss about the disappearance of 154 asylum seeker children from temporary hotel accommodation. Ms Braverman said missing persons cases were a matter for the police, but confirmed there were no longer any unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels.

The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said the proposed legislation amounted to an ""asylum ban"". Standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the slogan ""stop the boats"", Mr Sunak confirmed the planned new law, which will see illegal migrants deported ""within weeks"", would apply retrospectively to everyone arriving in the UK illegally from Tuesday.He said he knew there would be a debate about the toughness of the Illegal Migration Bill but the government had tried ""every other way"" of preventing the crossings and they had not worked.While he admitted it was a ""complicated problem"" with no single ""silver bullet"" to fix it, he said he would not be standing there if he did not think he could deliver.More than 45,000 people entered the UK via Channel crossings last year, up from about 300 in 2018.The government believes stopping small boats is a key issue for voters and Mr Sunak has made it one of his top five priorities. This is politically risky - as the outcome may not be entirely in his hands.Will this migrant bill become a reality?Small boat arrivals to be swiftly removed - BravermanSmall boats bill aims to drum up political supportSpeaking in the Commons, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said serious action was needed to stop small boat crossings, but said the government's plans risked ""making the chaos worse"".Opposition MPs attacked the legislation one after another, with some saying it was unlawful, while others suggested it would not work in practice.But Tory MPs backed their home secretary as they took turns to welcome the move, and Ms Braverman retorted that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer ""doesn't want to stop the boats"".Trying to set out the scale of the problem the home secretary said 100 million people around the world could qualify for protection under current UK laws - and ""they are coming here"".This refers to a UNHCR figure that there are more than 100 million people forcibly displaced around the world, although there is nothing to suggest they would all want to come to the UK.Acknowledging the likelihood of a legal battle, Ms Braverman wrote to Conservative MPs saying there was ""more than a 50% chance"" the legislation was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This potentially makes legal challenges - and a rough ride for the bill in the Lords - more likely.But the political calculation could well be that the new legislation puts clear blue water between government and opposition.And if the bill is stymied, the prime minister may be hoping he gets some political credit from voters for trying to find a solution.Mr Sunak told a Downing Street conference he believed it would not be necessary for the UK to leave the ECHR and said the government believed it was acting in compliance with it and ""meeting our international obligations"".He said part of the problem was people making one claim ""then down the line they can make another claim, and then another claim"" and said the UK cannot have a system which could be taken advantage of.The deterrent effect of the new legislation could be ""quite powerful quite quickly"", he added. Under the new bill:People removed from the UK will be blocked from returning or seeking British citizenship in futureMigrants will not get bail or be able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detentionThere will be a cap on the number of refugees the UK will settle through ""safe and legal routes"" - set annually by ParliamentA duty on the home secretary to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally, to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country - this will take legal precedence over someone's right to claim asylumUnder-18s, those medically unfit to fly, or those at risk of serious harm in the country they are being removed to will be able to delay removalAny other asylum claims will be heard remotely after removalThe UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it was ""profoundly concerned"" by the bill, calling it a ""clear breach"" of the refugee convention.""Most people fleeing war and persecution are simply unable to access the required passports and visas,"" it said.""There are no safe and 'legal' routes available to them. Denying them access to asylum on this basis undermines the very purpose for which the Refugee Convention was established.""The Refugee Council said it was ""not the British way of doing things"", with its chief executive Enver Solomon saying the plans were ""more akin to authoritarian nations"", while Amnesty International called it a ""cynical attempt to dodge basic moral and legal responsibilities"".Small boat arrivals to be swiftly removed - BravermanHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Small boats bill aims to drum up political supportDozens of child migrants still missing from seaside citySunak: We tried every other way on migrant boats, it hasn't workedWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationSuella BravermanRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64881908"
"9 August 2023","UK signs deal with Turkey to disrupt people-smuggling gangs","UK signs deal with Turkey to disrupt people-smuggling gangs9 August 2023ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterSharePA MediaThe UK and Turkey have agreed a new deal to disrupt people-smuggling gangs and tackle illegal migration. The partnership includes a ""centre of excellence"" in Turkey to strengthen collaboration and increase intelligence-sharing between enforcement agencies. The government said it would help to disrupt the supply chain of small boats parts through Europe. But it does not include a deal to return failed Turkish asylum seekers.Immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who visited Turkey last month, said the partnership was backed by some funding but he would not say how much, telling GB News it was ""not primarily about money"" but sharing information. How many people cross the Channel in small boats?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?The government said the new centre of excellence, which will be established by the Turkish National Police, would help the two countries share intelligence so staff could act more quickly on information. It said more officers would also be deployed to Turkey to enable collaboration between National Crime Agency and Home Office staff based in the country and their Turkish counterparts. A memorandum of understanding will also facilitate the quicker exchange of customs data and intelligence.The Home Office said the export of small boats and parts across Europe to facilitate illegal crossings were ""a vital element of smugglers' tactics"", with hundreds of parts estimated to be transported for this purpose each year.Turkey shares the largest and busiest border crossing point in Europe - the Turkish-Bulgarian check point at Kapikule. In the first seven months of this year 1,486 Turkish nationals crossed the Channel to the UK by small boat, becoming the second most common nationality to do so behind Afghans, according to Home Office figures. There has been a steady increase in Turkish arrivals since last year, with the country suffering a devastating earthquake in February which left an estimated 1.5 million people homeless. Turkey is also facing a worsening economic crisis, with inflation hovering stubbornly at just under 50%. The UK returned 191 Turkish nationals in 2022, with 1,076 arriving by small boats that year. However, the two countries have no formal returns agreement.Mr Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK was ""working very closely"" with Turkey to return Turkish nationals and putting in place arrangements to streamline the process. There is some optimism within government circles a returns deal with Turkey may not be far off, with the upcoming UK-Turkey Migration Dialogue meeting scheduled for the autumn in London.The European Union has an agreement with Turkey to return migrants crossing from the country illegally into the bloc. But since Brexit, the UK is no longer part of returns agreements between EU countries and 24 other nations.Mr Jenrick said while the UK wanted to work with the EU, returns arrangements ""didn't work well"" when the UK was part of the bloc.

""It really does highlight a continued level of incompetence. I call on the Home Office to withdraw funding for the hotel and review why this was allowed to happen.""Harben House hotel in Newport Pagnell is due to receive 270 asylum seekers, to be accommodated in about 150 roomsBarking and Dagenham council said it investigated Mahajan for converting three family homes in Barking, east London, into HMOs without planning permission.He falsely claimed they had been in use as HMOs for more than 10 years and were therefore immune from enforcement action, but the documents he supplied as evidence were forgeries.Mahajan was sentenced to 16 months in prison in early 2019 after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice and using copies of forged documents.In correspondence seen by the BBC, the Home Office told Milton Keynes Council in June it had identified Harben House ""as a site to accommodate asylum seekers"". 'Unacceptable'The property is owned by Bluebell Tame Ltd, of which Mahajan became director on 21 July. That company has since been taken over by his Tulip Real Estates business and the hotel was described on the company's website as ""one of the most ideal hotels in Milton Keynes"". The BBC understands it will be used as longer-term temporary accommodation for people awaiting decisions on their asylum claims.The Home Office said: ""We have been clear that the use of hotels to house asylum seekers is unacceptable.""There are currently more than 51,000 asylum seekers in hotels costing the UK taxpayer £6m a day.""We engage with local authorities as early as possible whenever sites are used for asylum accommodation and work to ensure arrangements are safe for hotel residents and local people.""'Transparency'A by-election is due to take place in the Newport Pagnell South ward of Milton Keynes City Council on 21 September.Jane Carr, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats on the council, said: ""Local residents deserve better, they need openness and transparency from the Home Office and we need our MP to provide re-assurances that those running contracts are responsible for their business practices and are fit for purpose.""Conservative MP for Milton Keynes North, Ben Everitt, said: ""I have already raised this directly with the Home Secretary and asked that the use of the site is suspended and a full investigation is conducted after the current cohort of asylum seekers are processed.

"12 June 2023","UK immigration: Little evidence Albanians at risk and need asylum","UK immigration: Little evidence Albanians at risk and need asylum12 June 2023ShareJune Kelly & Thomas MackintoshBBC NewsSharePA MediaThere is ""little evidence"" Albanians are at risk in their country and need asylum in the UK, a committee of MPs says. Albanian nationals should not routinely be granted asylum, the Home Affairs select committee said.A total of 51% of asylum claims by Albanians were initially accepted over six months to June last year.Some making asylum claims, particularly women, had been trafficked and need protection, MPs said.The government said it was working with Albania to stop illegal migration. It follows a rise in Albanian arrivals to the UK last year via small boats crossings.In a report published on Monday, the cross-party committee stressed Albanian migrants to the UK were unlikely to require asylum. It cited figures showing that 51% of Albanian cases were initially accepted in the first half of 2022 - the majority of these claimants arrived on ferries or planes rather than small boats.The committee said nine countries, including Germany, had accepted no asylum claims from Albania during that period. It called on the Home Office to explain why the UK's acceptance rate was so high - particularly compared to other countries.The report also highlighted figures showing that in 2022, more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the Channel in small boats came from Albania - ""and most claimed asylum"". It added the number of Albanians arriving in the UK by this route had gone from 800 in 2021, to 12,301 in 2022. ""Albania is a safe country,"" the MPs said. ""It is not at war and is a candidate country to join the European Union. ""There is no clear basis for the UK to routinely accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens, the committee finds."" Are fewer Albanian migrants coming to the UK?It suggested that driving factors for people coming to the UK from Albania largely included better job opportunities and higher wages.But the MPs also flagged there were ""unquestionably cases of Albanian citizens being trafficked to the UK"".It said more needed to be done to support the Albanian victims of people smuggling - especially women.Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, the committee's chairwoman, said there had been a ""substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country"".She said: ""While it is important that questions are asked and lessons are learnt, it is clear that the immigration picture is not static and will continue to evolve.""The MPs recommended the government promote seasonal work visas in agriculture and construction to give more Albanians the opportunity to come to the UK without making unauthorised Channel crossings.It also said appropriate safeguards must be put in place before any victims of trafficking were returned to Albania, and recommended the UK maintain strong links with the country's government.Dame Diana said: ""Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses.""She also said it was important the ""UK improves its overall approach to asylum"".Last week in Kent, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said his plan to tackle migration is progressing, but there is ""work to do"". He said a deal with Albania to return migrants had led to 1,800 people being sent back, and that was having a deterrent effect. A Home Office spokesperson said ""this government's priority is stopping the boats"". It went on: ""Last year, 28% of those who arrived by small boat to the UK were from Albania - a safe European country and Nato ally - placing further strain on our asylum system. ""We've worked closely with the Albanian government to disrupt criminal gangs and deter illegal migration. In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania. Thanks to changes to our asylum system, we have gone from accepting 1 in 5 Albanian asylum claims to just 1 in 50, in line with other European countries.

The UK has paid £240m to Rwanda, with a further £50m to come. So far, no asylum seekers have been sent to the country.Asked on why he was taking the money, Mr Kagame said: ""It's only going to be used if those people will come. If they don't come, we can return the money.""But Rwanda's government later specified there was ""no obligation"" to do so.In a statement after Mr Kagame's comments on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said that if the UK requests a refund ""we will consider this"".The president's remarks came before a key vote in the Commons, which saw MPs pass legislation to revive the deportation scheme, after it was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last year.The draft law will now head for further scrutiny in the House of Lords, where it is expected to run into considerable opposition.Sunak sees off Tory rebels as MPs back Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In its statement, the Rwandan government said funds paid to Rwanda were intended to support the country's economic development as well as to ""prepare to receive and care for the migrants when they arrive"".""Under the terms of the agreement, Rwanda has no obligation to return any of the funds paid,"" spokeswoman Yolande Makolo added.""However, if no migrants come to Rwanda under the scheme, and the UK government wishes to request a refund of the portion of the funding allocated to support the migrants, we will consider this request.""To talk about figures at this point is premature, as we are still awaiting the conclusion of the UK legislative process and remain committed to making the partnership work."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claims his plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to travel across the Channel in small boats.But Labour says it is an expensive ""gimmick"" that won't work - and that they would scrap the policy if they win the general election.'UK's problem'A vote on Wednesday evening saw MPs pass legislation to resurrect the scheme, after a Conservative rebellion failed to materialise.But dozens of Tory backbenchers made a failed attempt to amend the bill, arguing the legislation will not do enough to stop individual appeals derailing deportation flights. Ahead of the vote, the BBC's Economics Editor Faisal Islam grabbed a brief interview with Paul Kagame on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The president did not clarify how much of the money he could return to the UK, or when. Asked about the current political and legal obstacles around the deal with his country, Mr Kagame said that it is ""not Rwanda's problem"".

""Only this government can waste hundreds of millions of pounds on a removals policy that doesn't remove anyone.""Mr Sunak defended the government's record on immigration, before adding: ""It's a bit rich to hear him in here pretending that he cares about how we actually stop the boats, when he's been crystal clear and said that even if the plan is working to reduce the numbers, he would still scrap it.""It's because he has no values, no conviction and no plan, and it's back to square one.""The Home Office told BBC Verify the department's documents were leaked to The Telegraph and are not publicly available.It said the figures published are based on ""out of date operational data"" from last year.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman has challenged critics to try to ""get rid of me"", as she rejected claims she was to blame for dire conditions at a migrant processing centre.She denied blocking the use of hotels to ease overcrowding at the centre.She said her policies were designed to repel an ""invasion"" on the south coast.But Labour said Ms Braverman was not fit for office and undermined Rishi Sunak's claim he was bringing integrity back to government.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said decision-making at the Home Office had ""collapsed"" on Ms Braverman's watch and asked how ""anyone is supposed to have confidence"" in her.Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman as home secretary last week, only days after she quit over a security breach when Liz Truss was prime minister.But the decisions Ms Braverman made in her first stint as home secretary have come under intense scrutiny, with some MPs calling for her to resign for a second time.Some 4,000 people are being held at the Manston migrant processing centre, which is only designed to accommodate 1,600 people on a temporary basis.Hundreds of people were moved there on Sunday after a man threw firebombs at an immigration centre in Dover, before killing himself.Ms Cooper told MPs conditions at Manston ""have been described as inhumane, with risks of fire, disorder and infection"". Follow live: Suella Braverman asylum rowBraverman was warned about migrant overcrowdingHow many migrants cross the Channel in small boats?Manston opened as a processing centre in February 2022, for the growing number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats.Migrants are only supposed to be kept there for 24 hours for security and identity checks. They are then meant to be moved into the Home Office's asylum accommodation system, which often means a hotel.But when the chief inspector of immigration visited last week, he found some people had been there for over a month. That included one family who had been there for 32 days, sleeping on mats in a marquee.Sir Roger Gale, Tory MP for North Thanet, where the centre is located, blamed Ms Braverman for the situation, accusing her of failing to commission extra accommodation. He said the Manston site ""operated absolutely magnificently and very efficiently indeed until five weeks ago"". Sources have told the BBC the home secretary was warned by officials the government was acting outside the law by failing to provide alternative accommodation.One source said the advice was ""crystal clear"", while others called into question whether Ms Braverman could survive in her position.ReutersThe Manston facility (pictured here) is designed to accommodate 1,600 people on a temporary basisBut in a bullish statement in Parliament, Ms Braverman said ""I have never ignored legal advice"" by keeping people detained at Manston for longer than necessary.Responding to questioning by Ms Cooper, Ms Braverman said on no occasion did she block hotels or ""veto advice to procure extra and emergency accommodation"".She claimed ""on my watch"" the use of 30 new hotels had been agreed since 6 September and she had ""worked hard to find alternative accommodation to relieve the pressure at Manston"".Some MPs believe she was choosing her words carefully when she made clear she did not ""block"" hotels for asylum seekers and that more were used ""on her watch"".Facing down critical MPs, the home secretary said she was determined to address the backlog in asylum claims and the number of migrants living in hotels.So far this year, 39,898 people have made the journey from France on small boats, putting pressure on the UK's asylum system.Ms Braverman said her policies of co-operating with French authorities and sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda would curb Channel crossings.""The British people deserve to know which party is serious about stopping the invasion on our southern coast,"" Ms Braverman said, calling the current system ""broken"" and ""out of control"".""I'm determined to do whatever it takes,"" she went on. ""That is why I'm in government. That's why some people would prefer to be rid of me.""She then paused as her statement was interrupted by heckles from opposition MPs, before adding: ""Let them try.""Ms Braverman's description of small boats crossing the Channel as an ""invasion"" has drawn condemnation, with one refugee charity calling her comments ""indefensible"".Tommy Sheppard, an MP for the Scottish National Party, accused Ms Braverman of ""far-right and inflammatory rhetoric"".In her statement, Ms Braverman warned against using ""inflammatory language"" and spoke of a ""witch hunt"" against her, as she attempted to rally support among Tory MPs.But while home office ministers - including her political ally Steve Baker - joined her on the frontbench, many cabinet colleagues were conspicuous by their absence.The row has increased the pressure on Ms Braverman, who is also facing questions over the use of her personal email for government business.Her return as home secretary came as Mr Sunak sought to build a cabinet that unified a Conservative Party deeply divided after 12 years in power.Mr Sunak has faced questions over his decision to reappoint Ms Braverman, only six days after she quit for breaching ministerial rules.A popular MP on the right-wing of her party, Ms Braverman was keen to return as home secretary, but the scale of the challenge facing her is daunting.A record number of migrants have arrived in the UK on small boats this year, with nearly 1,000 making the crossing on Saturday and a further 468 crossing on Sunday.The government has said in the year ending June 2022, there were 63,089 asylum applications, 77% more than in 2019.The UK is spending almost £7m a day on hotels for asylum seekers - and the cost is likely to rise, MPs heard last week.Suella BravermanEnglish ChannelRefugees and asylum seekersEurope migrant crisisRight of asylum","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63463606"

Downing Street said Paul Bristow had made comments which ""were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility"". In a letter to the prime minister last week, Mr Bristow said ""a permanent ceasefire"" would save lives and allow aid to reach those who needed it most. The government supports ""humanitarian pauses"" but not a full ceasefire. During Prime Minister's Questions last week, Rishi Sunak said ""specific pauses"" would allow more aid into Gaza but he rejected calls to back a ceasefire, stressing that Israel had a right to defend itself. Mr Bristow, who is the Conservative MP for Peterborough, was a Parliamentary Private Secretary - the lowest rung of the ministerial ladder - to Michelle Donelan, the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.Labour suspends MP after pro-Palestinian rally speechAfter being sacked by Mr Sunak, he told the BBC: ""I completely understand the PM's decision. And it is with regret I leave a job I enjoyed. ""But I can now talk openly about an issue so many of my constituents care deeply about.  ""I believe I can do this better from the backbenches rather than as part of the government payroll.""A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Paul Bristow has been asked to leave his post in government following comments that were not consistent with the principles of collective responsibility.""Collective responsibility is the convention that all members of the government must publicly support government policy, even if they personally disagree with it.

Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is under increasing pressure to support a full ceasefire, with senior figures including London mayor Sadiq Khan, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and a number of frontbenchers supporting one. So far, Sir Keir has only backed humanitarian pauses, aligning him with the position of the UK government, as well as the US and EU. Compared to a formal ceasefire, humanitarian pauses tend to last for short periods of time, sometimes just a few hours.They are implemented purely with the aim of providing humanitarian support, as opposed to achieving long-term political solutions.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country ""will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"".""Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,"" Mr Netanyahu said.In his letter to the prime minister on Thursday, Mr Bristow, wrote: ""My constituents and I are deeply grieved by the heart-breaking and devastating humanitarian crisis now unfolding in Gaza. ""Thousands have been killed and more than one million now displaced.""It is difficult to understand how this makes Israel more secure or indeed makes anything better.""He added that some of his constituents had been directly affected by the conflict.Posting the letter on Facebook, he wrote that ordinary Palestinians ""should not suffer collective punishment for the crimes of Hamas"". Collective punishment is prohibited under international law.

According to one source, at least one of the meetings was held at the suggestion of the Israeli ambassador to London. In contrast, British diplomats in Israel were not informed about Ms Patel's plans.Ministers are by convention supposed to tell the Foreign Office when they are conducting official business overseas. Downing Street said Ms Patel was on a private holiday she had paid for herself, during which she took the opportunity to meet people. Ms Patel told the Guardian: ""Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip]. It is not on, it is not on at all.""I went out there, I paid for it. And there is nothing else to this. It is quite extraordinary. It is for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves.""But Labour have called for an investigation to examine whether Ms Patel breached the ministerial code and rules on lobbying.The meetings took place over two days in August while Ms Patel was on holiday in Israel. 'Freelance foreign policy'No civil servants were present but Ms Patel was accompanied by Lord Polak, honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), an influential lobbying organisation that has access to wealthy party donors.  Some ministers and MPs accused Ms Patel of trying to win favour with wealthy pro-Israeli Conservative donors who could fund a potential future leadership campaign.Others accused her of conducting her own ""freelance foreign policy"" on Israel. Ms Patel is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of CFI. Ministers also said there was a potential risk that the meetings could have broken the ministerial code of conduct which states that ""ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". Getty ImagesIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has been in London this weekOne minister said: ""This is outrageous. She is a Cabinet minister. She just cannot do this. This is about donors and influence.""One former minister said: ""What does it say to the rest of the Middle East if a senior Cabinet minister in charge of Britain's huge aid budget disappears for 48 hours from a family holiday in Israel and is under the wing of a pro-Israeli lobbyist?""The revelations risk embarrassing the government while the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in London to mark the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, when Britain first gave its support for a national home for the Jewish people.A senior Downing Street source denied Ms Patel had done anything wrong. And a source at the Department for International Development said it was a private holiday paid for by the Secretary of State herself. 'Blindsided'Foreign Office sources in London - and diplomatic sources in the region - confirmed that Ms Patel had not given them any warning of her visit. One minister said: ""Yes, we did not know about the trip. We were unsighted on it."" Another source said the British consulate in Jerusalem was ""blindsided"" and felt ""slightly bruised"".A third Foreign Office source said: ""We didn't know and would have expected to know, given the meetings she had.""Ms Patel took time out from her family holiday on 24 August to meet Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, a former finance minister in Mr Netanyahu's coalition government. Mr Lapid tweeted a picture of the meeting, saying it was ""great to meet Priti Patel"" whom he described as ""a true friend of Israel.""

'Fruitful partnership'Conservative Friends of Israel regularly pays for MPs and peers to visit Israel. But Lord Polak said that Ms Patel paid for the holiday herself and the trip had nothing to do with CFI. The peer said he organised for Ms Patel to visit Israeli firms and charities creating technologies that could be interesting to a Secretary of State for Development.

Lord Polak said Ms Patel also visited Innovation: Africa, an Israeli not-for-profit organisation developing new solar and water technologies for remote African communities.The fear among some Tory MPs is that Ms Patel also used the trip to discuss reducing her department's support for Palestinian groups. Palestinian fundingThe UK currently sends about £68m a year to support the Palestinian territories, most of it from DFID's budget. Some of the money is given directly to the Palestinian Authority, the rest through the local UN agency or individual groups. Critics claim that instead of just supporting Palestinian refugees and institutions, the money has also been used to pay salaries to Palestinians jailed for terrorism-related offences. Ms Patel has long been a critic of this funding. She tightened up the guidelines on Palestinian spending last year, focusing more on health and education, but one Foreign Office source said that she had recently tried to go further, presenting a paper to the prime minister and the foreign secretary for yet more restrictions on the funding. ""But they were not particularly impressed by her arguments,"" said one Foreign Office source. Another said: ""She has been trying this for some time. She has been pushing to get her hands on the PA aid budget and we have been pushing back.""Others suggested Ms Patel was getting close to CFI in preparation for a future leadership contest. One Whitehall source said: ""I have always understood it to be part of her leadership ambitions, if she has got people from CFI who are prepared to put money into her.""The BBC sent Ms Patel's office a list of questions concerning the visit to Israel which it declined to answer.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41853561"

Unfortunately, the drumbeat of what was going on elsewhere meant we couldn't get that message over on the doorsteps.""

While he has no intention of quitting, one MSP told me there was now an ""undercurrent of unhappiness"" with his leadership at Holyrood and that he would have to work hard to overcome that. The senior MSP Liz Smith has publicly questioned his flip-flop over Boris Johnson's resignation, telling The Times he has to ""explain why he is defending him as prime minister but blaming him for the result"".Former MSP Adam Tomkins has previously said Douglas Ross must ""own the consequences"" of backing the PM. While there's disquiet, his predecessor Ruth Davidson has pointed out that the result is the second best the Tories have got in Scottish local government for decades and urged the party to ""pull together"". There does not appear to be an organised attempt to topple Douglas Ross. No potential challenger has emerged. As one MSP put it: ""If there's a plot to oust him, no-one's asked me to join"". Saturday saw the start of negotiations between parties to work together on Scotland's councils. Most councils are not in the overall control of one party, and it could take weeks before the full picture of who will run Scotland's local authorities becomes clear.PA MediaNicola Sturgeon met her new Dundee councillors at the V&A on SaturdayThe SNP finished as the biggest party, with Labour moving into second after the Conservatives suffered big losses.Nicola Sturgeon's party took control in Dundee, while Anas Sarwar's Labour won a majority in West Dunbartonshire.The first minister hailed the result as an ""incredible outcome"" for her party. She met the new SNP councillors in Dundee on Saturday morning.On council arrangements, she said: ""That's for local council groups to determine what's in the best interests of the areas they serve, but I'm in a partnership agreement in government in Holyrood with the Greens, so clearly I'd be very open to seeing that replicated in council areas in Scotland.""But I think it's important that these decisions are driven locally and that we see parties that are prepared to recognise where they disagree but focus more on where they agree (and) come together to try to put arrangements in place that are in the best interest of the areas they serve.""SNP maintains position as largest party at Glasgow City CouncilSNP looks to create coalition in EdinburghWestminster leader Ian Blackford told Good Morning Scotland that the SNP was willing to work with parties with a ""progressive"" outlook.He said: ""I think that when I use the word progressive there is one party that doesn't fit that mould and that is the Conservative party. We will be extending the hand of friendship to others where we can work collaboratively and consensually to make sure that we put the interests of the voters and the communities first.""Scottish Labour said the election marked the start of its recovery.The party's health spokeswoman, MSP, Jackie Baillie, told BBC Scotland there would be meetings this weekend on the way forward.But she said there would be no formal coalitions.Getty ImagesAnas Sarwar said that Labour was back in Scotland""As the person who chairs this process over the course of this weekend, we will be bringing together councillors, their proposals, alongside the Scottish executive committee of the party to consider wat arrangements work best at a local level,"" she said. ""What we have ruled out are formal coalitions but there are a lot of other arrangements that people come to and have been enjoying in the past that make a lot of sense to those local communities. We want to reflect on those and do what is right for the local community.""Leader Anas Sarwar visited his new Labour-run West Dunbartonshire Council. He said: ""Today there is no doubt that Scottish Labour is back.""Nicola Sturgeon wants to pretend that the next general election is Scotland versus England, but it isn't - it will be Boris versus Britain, and Britain will win. ""For 15 years the SNP have tried to stoke up bitterness, division, and anger - but there is new hope, energy and positivity from Scottish Labour to challenge them. ""'Anxiety about deals'Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Alex Cole Hamilton, increased the party's council seat count by 20 to 87. The party is in a strong position to work with other parties.But he told Good Morning Scotland there were some parties he would have problems with.""We have concerns [about] the focus of parties such as the SNP who are looking at an independence referendum as a principal priority, I would struggle to see how that shares the values we have of localism and driving down the cost of living, improving local services,"" he said.

"13 November 2023","James Cleverly: Protests and asylum fill new home secretary's in-tray","James Cleverly: Protests and asylum fill new home secretary's in-tray13 November 2023ShareMark EastonBBC Home editorShareEPAJames Cleverly arrived at the Home Office pledging to run the department in his own style.The role of home secretary is one of the biggest jobs in government, with responsibility for the police, immigration, and national security. Asked if he wanted to distance himself from the rhetoric of his predecessor, Suella Braverman, he said: ""I intend to do this job in the way that I feel best protects the British people and our interests.""The new home secretary has a bulging in-tray. Top of the pile will be the legacy of the row over pro-Palestinian protests. Downing Street is understood to want him immediately to review police powers to make it easier to ban marches and prosecute those glorifying terrorism.But this won't be straightforward. Lowering the bar to ban protests would almost certainly lead to a legal challenge that such a change breaches the right to freedom of assembly and association as set out in the European Convention of Human Rights, and enshrined in UK law.Police condemn far-right violence on day of protestWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Prohibiting a protest march is only lawful ""in the interests of national security"" or to prevent ""serious public disorder"". Senior officers policing major protests would argue that the decision on when and where to arrest individuals is an operational matter.  There is the risk that using snatch squads to arrest marchers for hate crimes could make public disorder more likely.Less than two days into the job, Mr Cleverly will have to deal with whatever decision the Supreme Court makes on the lawfulness of the government's Rwanda policy.  That judgement will be issued on Wednesday morning and were the Home Office to lose, the new home secretary would face an immediate crisis.Even if the government win, the policy is likely to see further legal challenges from individual asylum seekers attempting to avoid being sent to Rwanda.Mr Cleverly has said the prime minister had made it clear to him that ""he wants to deliver on promises, to stop the boats, to protect the British people, make sure everyone feels secure in their lives."" More than 26,000 migrants have crossed the Channel so far this year, significantly lower than at this point last year, but the government believes the threat of being sent to East Africa is the best way to stop the smuggling gangs.The new home secretary also inherits an asylum system in meltdown with 175,000 people waiting for an initial decision on their claim and tens of thousands still in hotels, costing around £8m a day.  One immediate dilemma for him is that the Home Office plan to move people out of hotels and into other accommodation includes a proposal to house 1,700 single male migrants at a former RAF base at Wethersfield near Braintree in Essex.   That is in Mr Cleverly's constituency and he has previously expressed opposition to using the site. James Cleverly's style is very different to Suella Braverman.  At the Foreign Office he came across as measured and diplomatic.  It was a job he loved.  When it was suggested he might become defence secretary in a previous reshuffle, he said that if removed, ""you will see nail marks on the parquet floor in my office"". He will need a different approach to reflect the government's determination to look tough on crime and punishment in the run up to the next election.

                                Liz Truss became prime minister on 6 September 2022, replacing Boris Johnson who was in post for slightly more than three years.She was not the first choice of Conservative MPs - but she was the clear winner in a ballot of Tory members, who had the final say. Truss has been a government minister since 2012, and held cabinet posts under David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson, most recently as foreign secretary. A Remain supporter at the 2016 EU referendum, who began her political journey at Oxford University as a Liberal Democrat, she is now an enthusiastic Brexiteer who has vowed to get back to traditional tax-cutting Tory values.Truss, who has two children, was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform.

                                Kwasi Kwarteng was chancellor for 38 days before being asked by the prime minister to stand aside after a turbulent few weeks for the UK economy.The former business secretary is a close friend and ally of Liz Truss, and backed her successful leadership campaign.But his ""mini-budget"" pledging £45bn of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, was followed by market turbulence and an intervention from the Bank of England.His departure means he is the second shortest-serving UK chancellor since the Second World War.Kwarteng, who got a scholarship to Eton and studied at Cambridge, worked in finance before his time in politics, and has written a book about the legacy of the British Empire.

                                James Cleverly is the new foreign secretary, taking over Liz Truss’s former department.It won’t be a totally new department for him - he’s been a foreign minister before, for the Middle East and North Africa, and later for Europe and North America. He most recently served as education secretary under Boris Johnson.Cleverly was in the Territorial Army and went to Sandhurst and, outside of work, enjoys painting model soldiers and hanging out with his border terriers.He’ll have a busy brief ahead as foreign secretary with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the UK government’s current plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol – part of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU.

                                Suella Braverman has nabbed one of the “great offices of state” as home secretary, tasked with things like the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. She’s a barrister who was previously the attorney general and ran to be the leader herself in the Tory leadership contest.Her parents emigrated to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, and both spent time in local politics – with her mother being a councillor for 16 years. She has two children, studied law at Cambridge, and loves sushi. Braverman was the first cabinet minister to take maternity leave – after the law was changed so that cabinet ministers could receive paid maternity leave, having previously been expected to resign their posts.

                                Ben Wallace remains the defence secretary, a post he's held since July 2019.While almost all the other posts have seen a big mix-up, this continuity was anticipated given he's been leading the response to the war in Ukraine.He's popular with Tory members - and was once considered a favourite to replace Boris Johnson - but chose not to stand in the leadership contest.While some of the characters in Truss's new cabinet are more divisive in the Tory party, Wallace is pretty widely respected across the parliamentary party with many colleagues seeing him as a safe pair of hands. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland - where he helped thwart an IRA bomb attack.

                                Nadhim Zahawi has been a fast riser in the party - gaining support and public recognition in his role as vaccines minister during the pandemic.As chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster he'll be responsible for running the Cabinet Office, the department that supports the prime minister and basically helps departments work together better on issues that involve more than one.He'll also be the equalities minister. Zahawi was previously chancellor of the exchequer but for only two months - having been promoted when Rishi Sunak resigned - and pretty swiftly afterwards said Boris Johnson should resign.He's a former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s and co-founded the market research firm YouGov. He is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the Commons.

                                Simon Clarke has been promoted to the full cabinet as levelling up, housing and communities secretary, taking over from Greg Clark, who replaced Michael Gove in July.He was previously chief secretary to the Treasury but chose to support Liz Truss for the leadership rather than his former boss Rishi Sunak.The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department and describes himself as a lifelong Boro fan.Clarke, who has agoraphobia, is a qualified solicitor who worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017.

                                Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given the role of business (and energy) secretary and his appointment certainly signals the potential direction of travel for this government. One of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers - previously in cabinet as Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister - he's very pro-deregulation of business and wants to remove a host of rules and regulations post-Brexit.He's also been a critic in the past of what he's called “climate alarmism” and has been very pro-fracking.One of the first MPs to back Liz Truss for the leadership, Rees-Mogg set up his own investment management company in 2007, is a father-of-six, and describes himself as an avid cricket fan.

                                Kemi Badenoch has entered the cabinet as international trade secretary after surprising many by reaching the last four in the leadership contest.The former minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and equalities minister, who did not endorse any of her rivals in the leadership race, replaces Anne-Marie Trevelyan.Badenoch, who has been outspoken on issues such as gender-neutral toilets which she opposes, stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform and argued for the state to be slimmed down.The former software engineer worked in banking and later as a director of the Spectator magazine before being elected to the London Assembly.She became MP for Saffron Walden in Essex in 2017, and lists her interests as including engineering and technology, social mobility and integration.

                                Chloe Smith replaces new Health Secretary Thérèse Coffey as work and pensions secretary.She had been a minister in the department since September 2021 and was an early supporter of Liz Truss’s leadership bid.In June 2021 the mother-of-two announced she had been given the all clear from breast cancer after her diagnosis the previous November and says she is now back to full health and full of energy.A keen cyclist, Smith highlights her interest in transport and her work to help reduce youth unemployment in her constituency of Norwich North.Before entering parliament in 2009 - following a by-election sparked by the resignation of the sitting Labour MP after the expenses scandal - she worked for accountancy and professional service firm Deloitte.

                                Alok Sharma will stay on as president for COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, working in the Cabinet Office.This is pretty expected - as the role will expire soon.But what will be interesting to watch is how he leaves when it does. He's previously warned he would ""quit"" if the new prime minister scraps any of the UK's commitments to net zero.The new Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has previously expressed scepticism at the need to fight climate change, so this new working relationship will be one to watch.

                                Brandon Lewis is in the cabinet for a third time, this time in the role of justice secretary, replacing Dominic Raab.The former Northern Ireland secretary, who resigned in July, initially backed Nadhim Zahawi for the leadership but endorsed Liz Truss at the start of August.He had previously been party chairman and minister without portfolio in Theresa May’s cabinet and served as a minister in several departments under May, David Cameron, Boris Johnson.A qualified barrister and former company director, Lewis was a borough councillor in Brentwood for 10 years - five as leader - before entering parliament.The father-of-two, who became Great Yarmouth MP in 2010, took up triathlon the year after he was elected and has completed two London Marathons.

                                Kit Malthouse replaces new Foreign Secretary James Cleverly as education secretary.The former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for running the Cabinet Office, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race.He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"".Malthouse was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015.A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, the father-of-three lists his interests as including gardening, reading and watching modern dance.

                                Anne-Marie Trevelyan has become transport secretary, replacing Grant Shapps.She had previously been international trade secretary, replacing Liz Truss in the role in 2021, and before that had been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped.An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa May’s Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race.The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing.

                                Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July.The former chief whip’s new position was one that initially proved hard to fill, and certainly is regarded by some as a bit of a poisoned chalice right now - the nation is currently without a functioning devolved government.One of his key priorities will be resolving tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the Brexit deal that Liz Truss wants to override - which the DUP has argued is necessary if it is to re-enter into power sharing in Northern Ireland. The qualified football referee describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic but may well need to engage with the EU in negotiations about this.Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market.

                                Robert Buckland remains secretary of state for Wales, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hart’s resignation in July.The former barrister had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general.He previously backed Rishi Sunak for Tory leader, before switching to Liz Truss, which made him some foes among Sunak's camp who accused him privately of serving his own interests. He is Welsh, born in Llanelli, but represents a seat in South Swindon rather than in Wales - which isn't usual practice and could prove controversial. Buckland has twin children and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket.

                                Penny Mordaunt has returned to the cabinet as leader of the House of Commons, responsible for delivery of the government’s legislative programme, replacing Mark Spencer.She endorsed Liz Truss after nearly beating her into the final two of the Conservative leadership race.Most recently a trade minister, the naval reservist made history when she became the UK's first female defence secretary in 2019 and had also been in cabinet in 2017 as international development secretary.The former magician’s assistant is perhaps best known outside Westminster for appearing on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash!Before becoming MP for Portsmouth North in 2010 she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, and a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK.

                                Lord True has been named leader of the House of Lords, responsible for delivery of the government’s legislative programme in the Upper House.A former Cabinet Office minister, he replaces Baroness Evans who had held the position since 2016.Before being made a life peer in 2010, True had been leader of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and before that had worked in John Major’s policy unit when he was prime minister.A fluent Italian speaker, who has previously lived and studied in the country, he lists his interests as including history, gardening and sport.

                                Michelle Donelan has been appointed culture secretary, giving her a second chance to make her mark in cabinet following her resignation two days into the job of education secretary in July.The former higher and further education minister replaces Nadine Dorries, having backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race.Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE.The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time.

                                Jake Berry is the new minister without portfolio and Conservative party chairman, replacing Andrew Stephenson.He will be responsible for trying to gear the party up for the next election - Stephenson's predecessor Oliver Dowden resigned after a bruising set of by-elections for the Conservative party earlier this year.Berry will have to engage with Tory associations around the country (some of which weren't particularly happy at Boris Johnson's ousting), and help unite the party after months of infighting. He was previously Northern Powerhouse minister and has been chairman of the Northern Research Group, representing many of the Tory MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in 2019.The group, and Berry in particular, have pushed the government repeatedly on what it is doing to “level up” and invest in those kinds of areas, which will likely form a big part of any future election strategy of his.

                                Wendy Morton has been appointed chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring Conservative MPs vote along party lines, and will attend cabinet.The former assistant whip backed Liz Truss at the start of the leadership contest and replaces Chris Heaton-Harris in the role.Morton, who has also been a transport and Foreign Office minister, says her interests include walking, cookery, art deco and ceramics.She was first elected MP for the West Midlands constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills in 2015, having missed out to Truss’s rival Rishi Sunak in a bid to become the party candidate for Richmond in 2014.

                                Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, attending cabinet, and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke.The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July.Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks.He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015.

                                Michael Ellis has been appointed attorney general - the chief legal adviser to the government - and can attend cabinet.He replaces new Home Secretary Suella Braverman, having previously filled in for her when she went on maternity leave in 2021.A former Cabinet Office minister and paymaster general, Ellis supported Liz Truss’s rival Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership race.Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before entering parliament and his legal experience has previously led to him getting the role of solicitor general for England and Wales in 2019.He was elected MP for Northampton North in 2010.

                                Edward Argar will attend cabinet after being named paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, replacing new Attorney General Michael Ellis.The former health minister, who resigned in July, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race after initially backing ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid.Before entering parliament he worked in management consultancy and communications at various companies including outsourcing firm Serco and was a city councillor in Westminster.He has been MP for Charnwood since 2015 and lists his interests as including gardening, tennis and watching cricket.

                                Vicky Ford has become development minister at the Foreign Office and will attend cabinet.The former MEP and South Cambridgeshire local councillor was an early supporter of Liz Truss in the leadership race. Before entering politics she worked as managing director of an international bank and was involved in raising money for infrastructure projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Ford, who has three children, was elected MP for Chelmsford in 2017 and lists her interests as including cricket, fly fishing, gardening and singing.

                                Tom Tugendhat will attend cabinet as security minister in the Home Office, after reaching the final five in the Conservative leadership race.The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post.His backing of Liz Truss after being eliminated from the leadership race was surprising to many in the Conservative party - given he's always been considered part of the more “centrist” One Nation group of Tory MPs.Tugendhat will now sit in a government largely skewed to the right-wing of the party.He was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021, and of Boris Johnson during his premiership, but now he's in a government role his outspoken interventions are likely to be toned down.

                                James Heappey will continue as minister for the armed forces, and take on the veterans brief, in the Ministry of Defence. He'll now attend cabinet too though - the top table of government ministers. He's a former soldier who spent 10 years in the Army, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, and his profile rose significantly during the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan and more recently the Ukraine war.He's considered a strong communicator and he, like his boss Ben Wallace who is staying on as defence secretary, does seem to bridge divisions across the Tory party factions. Heappey describes himself as a very keen sportsman who also loves to cook.

Newcomers includes ministers who did not attend the most recent cabinet.Click here if you cannot see the Cabinet GuideThere was quite a big turnover in Ms Truss's reshuffle, with several high-profile members of the previous cabinet leaving. The replacements include 13 new members who have taken up cabinet roles for the first time.After all the comings and goings, there are now two more women serving in the cabinet than there were under Boris Johnson, taking the total to nine. That makes up 30% overall, which is the same as the first cabinets under Gordon Brown and Theresa May. As for the education of those assembled by Ms Truss, 68% of them went to private schools, up slightly when compared with Mr Johnson's 2019 cabinet and up greatly when compared with Theresa May's in 2016.At 35%, Ms Truss's new cabinet has the lowest proportion of members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge since Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

"13 October 2022","Alicia Kearns elected as chair of Foreign Affairs Committee","Alicia Kearns elected as chair of Foreign Affairs Committee13 October 2022ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareUK ParliamentAlicia Kearns was elected to Parliament in 2019 as Conservative MP for Rutland and MeltonMPs have chosen Conservative Alicia Kearns as the new chair of the influential Foreign Affairs Committee - the first woman to hold the post. This is the second time in a row that an up and coming, but relatively junior MP has seized the chair of the committee, one of the most prestigious berths on the Commons committee corridor.Back in 2017, it was Tom Tugendhat, with just two years in Parliament under his belt, who ousted ex-minister Crispin Blunt. Five years on, he was a candidate for the Conservative leadership and is now security minister, attending the cabinet. The new incumbent has a background in crisis communications working in several government departments - and her victory over a field including former party leader Sir Ian Duncan Smith, former Defence Secretary Liam Fox and senior backbencher Richard Graham might be seen as a remarkable upset. The chair of Foreign Affairs was reserved for a Conservative MP under a deal dividing up which party chairs which committee. But all MPs could vote, and with four Tories vying for the post, the winner is always the candidate capable of attracting the most supporters from Labour, the SNP and the other parties. So while her alleged role in the ""pork pie plot"" against Boris Johnson might have lost her votes on here own side, it might have attracted non-Tory MPs to her banner. With the war in Ukraine and other ominous events across the globe, her victory gives Ms Kearns a prominent role when MPs consider events abroad - the chair of the select committee is always called early to speak in the Chamber. So her views will be heard. Often. MP condemns PM's Partygate account as 'misleading'House of CommonsAlicia KearnsForeign Affairs Select Committee","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63235415"
"17 August 2022","Abuse of BBC journalist was disgraceful, says Nicola Sturgeon","Abuse of BBC journalist was disgraceful, says Nicola Sturgeon17 August 2022ShareShareBBCJames Cook was called a ""traitor"" outside the Conservative leadership hustings in PerthNicola Sturgeon has described the abuse of a BBC journalist by independence supporters as ""disgraceful"".Protesters outside the Conservative leadership hustings in Perth shouted insults including ""you're a traitor"" and ""scumbag rat"" at James Cook.There were also reports of eggs being thrown and people being spat at as they arrived at the event. The first minister said abusing journalists was never acceptable, and described Mr Cook as a ""total pro"". Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""Their job is vital to our democracy and it is important to report and scrutinise, not support any viewpoint.""James Cook is a journalist of the highest quality and a total pro - the behaviour he was subjected to last night was disgraceful.""She later said she did not believe those involved had been SNP members, but that ""appropriate action"" would be taken if they were. Calls for reckoning over online abuse in politicsA video of the exchange between Mr Cook and protesters outside the Perth Concert Hall on Tuesday evening was posted online by one of those involved in the demonstration before later being deleted.It showed insults being shouted at Mr Cook, the BBC's Scotland editor, before a woman asked him how long he had been in Scotland and whether he knew about the Claim of Right 1689.Mr Cook replied that he was Scottish before adding: ""I'm not going to be starting asking you how long you've been in Scotland, I think it's a bit of a rude question.""Getty ImagesAfter abuse continued to be shouted, Mr Cook said: ""It's a waste of time. I'm very much trying to have a civilised conversation with you, in our nation, which we share.""But I can't have a civilised conversation because this gentleman calls me 'traitor' and 'scum' and screams me down.""The BBC described Mr Cook as an ""exceptional correspondent"" who ""showed professionalism throughout the incident"".It added: ""It is never acceptable for journalists to suffer abuse of any nature while doing their job.""The BBC has faced accusations of bias - which it strongly denies - from many within the pro-independence movement since the 2014 referendum campaign.PA MediaA small group of protesters carrying signs criticising the treatment of migrants and refugees broke through barriers and ran towards the door of the venueMr Cook's predecessor as the broadcaster's Scotland editor, Sarah Smith, has previously spoken of the ""criticism, bile and hatred"" she faced while covering politics in the country.Ms Smith said she was frequently subjected to insults and misogyny, and had been ""demonised quite heavily amongst certain parts of the population"".SNP MSP James Dornan had to issue an apology after initially claiming Ms Smith had ""imagined"" or ""exaggerated"" her story.There were reports of abuse and eggs being hurled at Tory members as they arrived to hear leadership rivals Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak speak. Protesters hung banners saying ""Tory Scum Out"" and ""Scottish not British"" outside the venue, with one group breaking through the barriers and running towards the door of the concert hall before retreating.Holly Moscrop, the national chair of the Scottish Young Conservatives, said her coat had been grabbed, she was spat on and had misogynistic abuse screamed at her near the entrance to the venue. ReutersMs Moscrop told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""The protesters were leaning right over the railing and one of them grabbed my coat.""They were screaming abuse right in my face to the point that they were spitting in my face.""They were shouting that I was a Tory whore, telling me that I should die and kill myself and that we were Tory scum.""I was genuinely really scared that they were going to come over the barrier and that they were going to do something"". Scotsman journalist Alistair Grant said he was one of those who had been hit by an egg.He tweeted: ""Can 100% confirm that when I arrived at the Tory leadership hustings, eggs were being thrown towards the queue of party members waiting to get in to the venue.""Regret to say an egg just hit my leg. Can't stress how uncomfortable it is to have an eggy sock.""ReutersThere were reports of eggs being thrown at Conservative members as they queued outside the Perth Concert HallScottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said people trying to attend the hustings had faced a ""gauntlet of hate"" outside. He added: ""Everyone is entitled to peacefully protest and make their voice heard against politicians they disagree with - that's the essence of democracy - but, not for the first time, a mob of extremist nationalists crossed a line.""It's shameful that journalists doing their job and ordinary party members, some of them elderly, had to run a gauntlet of hate just to get into the venue, including having eggs thrown at them and being spat at.""Police Scotland said there had been no arrests at the protest, with Ch Supt Phil Davison insisting that an ""appropriate policing plan was in place to maintain public safety and minimise disruption"".He added: ""We have a duty under the European Convention on Human Rights to protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter-protest, balanced against the rights of the wider community.""It wasn't a huge surprise to see a crowd of protestors outside the venue. Many of the same banners were draped over the same railings at the last hustings in 2019.Some were slightly taken aback though at the scale and ferocity of the event, with insults and the occasional egg flying while a large sound system boomed out some rather sweary speeches.There was a fairly partisan atmosphere inside at times too, with members booing and heckling some questions from the host, broadcaster Colin Mackay.Political leaders are at pains to paint any abuse as the work of an extremely vocal minority.But there is no mistaking the fact that politics has a fairly angry tinge to it right now.People are struggling amid rising prices and fuel bills, and it's only going to get worse as we move into winter.Trust in politicians was plumbing new depths even before the cost of living crisis, and now inflation and interest rates are on the rise and wage disputes are commonplace.Whoever wins the Tory leadership is going to face a huge challenge in cooling the atmosphere of debate and bringing people together in such circumstances.Read more from Phil hereConservative PartyNicola SturgeonBBCPerthScottish ConservativesScottish independenceTory leadership","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-62576062"

The BBC said it considered Lineker's ""recent social media activity to be a breach of our guidelines"".It added he should ""keep well away from taking sides on party political issues or political controversies"".Follow live reaction as BBC says Lineker to step back from presenting Gary Lineker: Football star who became a Saturday TV fixtureWhy Lineker's comments present problem for the BBCStopping small boats is priority for people - PMThe BBC asked Lineker to step back after ""extensive discussions with Gary and his team in recent days"".It ""decided that he will step back from presenting Match of the Day until we've got an agreed and clear position on his use of social media"", the statement said.It continued: ""When it comes to leading our football and sports coverage, Gary is second to none. ""We have never said that Gary should be an opinion free zone, or that he can't have a view on issues that matter to him, but we have said that he should keep well away from taking sides on party political issues or political controversies.""The move has led to Saturday's Match of the Day going ahead without presenters or pundits - as one by one contributors ruled themselves out.First, Ian Wright said he would not appear in ""solidarity"", tweeting: ""Everybody knows what Match of the Day means to me, but I've told the BBC I won't be doing it tomorrow. Solidarity."" Alan Shearer, who also presents on the show, said he had ""informed the BBC that I won't be appearing on MOTD tomorrow night"". They were followed shortly after by contributors Jermaine Jenas and Micah Richards who both said that while they were not due to work on Saturday's programme, they would not have appeared. Ex-England player Alex Scott also indicated she would not go on the show.The BBC said the programme would instead ""focus on match action without studio presentation or punditry"".Lineker has not yet publicly commented but while presenting 5News earlier, former BBC presenter Dan Walker read out a text live on air from the 62-year-old.Walker said he had messaged Lineker asking: ""What is happening. Are you stepping back?""He said he had received a reply saying: ""No, they've [the BBC] told me I have to step back.""On Tuesday, Home Secretary Suella Braverman outlined the government's plans to ban people arriving in the UK illegally from ever claiming asylum, in a bid to address a rise in the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats.Lineker reacted to it on Twitter calling it an ""immeasurably cruel policy directed at the most vulnerable people in language that is not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"".Ms Braverman hit out at Lineker's tweet, saying it ""diminishes the unspeakable tragedy"" of the Holocaust.Speaking on the BBC's Political Thinking podcast, the home secretary said the Nazi comparison was ""lazy and unhelpful"" and said her family ""feel very keenly the impact of the Holocaust"" as her husband is Jewish.Many opposition MPs and charities also strongly objected to the government's plans. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the proposals saying stopping the arrival of small boats is a ""priority"" for the British people. Richard Ayre, former controller of editorial policy at the BBC, who also served as a member of the regulator Ofcom's content board, said the corporation had ""no choice"" but to take action against Lineker after his tweets criticising the government's asylum policy.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, he said: ""I think it was inevitable. He [Lineker] has the letters BBC written across his forehead and yet he's plunged right into the most controversial story of the day.""He said BBC Director General Tim Davie had ""clearly tried"" to reach an agreement with Lineker but failed, adding: ""It's inevitable now that having in effect not sacked him but removed him temporarily at least, the BBC will now come under a torrent of criticism saying it's acting under the government's behest.""A Labour source told the BBC that the corporation should ""rethink their decision"". It said: ""The BBC's cowardly decision to take Gary Lineker off air is an assault on free speech in the face of political pressure.""Tory politicians lobbying to get people sacked for disagreeing with government policies should be laughed at, not pandered to. The BBC should rethink their decision.""Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the BBC's decision ""indefensible"". Writing on Twitter, she said the corporation was ""undermining free speech in the face of political pressure - and it does always seem to be right-wing pressure it caves to"".The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement: ""Individual cases are a matter for the BBC.""Lineker has hosted Match of the Day since 1999 and is the BBC's highest paid star, having earned about £1.35m in 2020-21.He is employed by the BBC on a freelance basis.

The group are among the most vocal critics of China in the UK. It comes in retaliation for measures taken by the UK government on Monday over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. Boris Johnson said those sanctioned were ""shining a light"" on ""gross human rights violations"". ""Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them,"" the prime minister said in a tweet. The foreign secretary said if Beijing wanted to ""credibly rebut"" the claims it should allow UN access to Xinjiang.Those targeted by China include former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, two peers, a lawyer and an academic. Sir Iain said he would wear the sanctions ""as a badge of honour"".The response by China follows similar sanctions imposed on the European Union, which was part of the co-ordinated action on Monday, along with the UK, the US and Canada.China has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.It has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism.Western states sanction China for Uighur 'abuses'Who are the Uighurs?Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rapeNike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton The nine people facing sanctions are: Tory MPs Sir Iain, Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and peers Baroness Kennedy and Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on ChinaTory MPs Tom Tugendhat and Neil O'Brien, who lead the China Research GroupLawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the Uighur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the UighursThey will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them.Sir Iain said: ""Those of us who live free lives under the rule of law must speak for those who have no voice. If that brings the anger of China down upon me then I shall wear that as a badge of honour.""Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: ""I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them.""He added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been ""constantly and continuously seeking to intervene"" in the internal matters of the UK. Ms Ghani told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move was a ""wake-up call"" for democratic countries, that China would sanction law-makers who were just doing their job. She added: ""I won't be intimidated. This has now made me even more determined to speak out about the Uighurs.""Academic Dr Smith Finley tweeted: ""I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced.""Lord Alton said: ""The imposition of tit-for-tat sanctions is a crude attempt to silence criticism,"" adding that the ""first duty of a parliamentarian is to use their voice on behalf of those whose voices have been silenced"". Relations 'will deteriorate further'This retaliation by the Chinese government was not unexpected. From the moment the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials earlier in the week, a response from Beijing was inevitable. But that does not mean the tit-for-tat exchange of sanctions is unimportant. It will ensure that the UK's already poor relationship with China will deteriorate further. And that matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing. In its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a ""systemic competitor"" and ""the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But it also spoke of pursuing ""a positive trade and investment relationship"" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government ""stands in total solidarity"" with those sanctioned by China. ""It's not going to stop them, it's not going to stop the British government speaking up about the industrial scale human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang,"" he told the BBC. He added that China should allow access to Xinjiang for the United Nation's commissioner for human rights if it wanted to continue with ""blanket denials"". Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a ""direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government"". She welcomed Mr Raab's condemnation of the sanctions but criticised the government's ""mixed messages"" on trade deals with China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions ""flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations"".He added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to ""lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation"". A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, later told a press briefing China was forced to act ""in self-defence"" in response to UK sanctions ""based on lies"".A spokesman from the Chinese embassy in London criticised the UK's use of sanctions adding that China ""never provokes confrontation"" but if others do ""we are ready to keep them company"". China 'targeting' Boris JohnsonChina has gone for the people exerting the most pressure on Boris Johnson to be tough on China. It's gone for the people who say ""genocide"" has happened in Xinjiang. The measures are essentially tokenistic - it's unlikely these people or entities did any business with Chinese firms or people anyway. Targeting Neil O'Brien is personal for the UK prime minister. The MP is in charge of leading policy in Downing Street. Going after Essex Court Chambers - a group of self-employed barristers - for a legal opinion it reached also shows you how China views an independent judicial system. It doesn't believe in them.Four groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers.A legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a ""very credible case"" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. An Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China spokesman said: ""The decision to sanction five of our British members is a flagrant assault on those parliamentarians' rights to conduct their duties. ""We will be making urgent representations to ministers and the House authorities to see that they're protected from danger or harm as a result of the communist party's bullying.""After UK sanctions were announced on Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang ""one of the worst human rights crises of our time"".More than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.Xinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's biggest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government.Uighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations.The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families.The country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses.You may also be interested in:China is forcing hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities into hard, manual labour in the vast cotton fields of Xinjiang, according to research seen by the BBC.

"14 August 2023","Are more small boats being stopped by French police?","Are more small boats being stopped by French police?14 August 2023ShareTamara Kovacevic and Lucy GilderBBC VerifyShareAFPHealth Secretary Steve Barclay has defended the government's progress in stopping small boats carrying migrants from crossing the English Channel.He told BBC Breakfast the government was working constructively with the French authorities and claimed: ""there's been 40% more boats stopped by the French authorities this year than last year"".But that's not correct according to currently available figures.How many boats have been stopped?The UK and French governments have not yet published figures for the numbers of small boats stopped this year.The Department of Health and Social Care told BBC Verify that Mr Barclay had actually been referring to Home Office figures comparing 2022 with 2021 and ""misspoke on the year"". The Home Office published those figures in January 2023 and said that the French authorities prevented 33,000 crossings in 2022, which was an increase of more than 40% on the number of crossings prevented in 2021.  How many people cross the Channel in small boats and how many claim asylum?Rishi Sunak's five promises: What progress has he made?Fact-checking claims about asylum seekersBut the government told us that this data refers to individual people prevented from crossing the Channel, not boats as Mr Barclay stated. The Home Office also confirmed to us that the French authorities intercepted 1,381 boats in 2022. We have asked for comparable figures for 2021, but have not yet seen them.While the number of interceptions increased between 2021 and 2022, the proportion of people stopped from crossing fell slightly: 43% of people who attempted to cross the Channel in small boats were stopped in 2022, compared with approximately 50% the year before, according to a Home Office official's evidence to MPs.

Nicola Sturgeon's party took 37 seats while Scottish Labour took 36. Council leader Susan Aitken retained her Langside seat but lost her majority of first preference votes to Holly Bruce from the Scottish Greens. In nearby West Dunbartonshire, Scottish Labour won control of the council. The council previously had no overall majority but was led by the SNP. Early Labour gains in Scottish council electionsA simple guide to the Scottish council electionsHow to follow the election results on the BBCThe final result in Glasgow was 37 seats for the SNP, a drop of two, and a five-seat gain for Labour at 36. The Scottish Greens gained three new seats taking their total to 10, while the Scottish Conservatives lost six seats leaving them with two. Scotland's first minister hailed a ""seismic"" result after Tory councillor David Meikle - the husband of former MP Natalie McGarry - lost his seat in the Pollokshields ward to the SNP. Ms Sturgeon said on Twitter: ""National/city trends aside, this result is seismic. For years, Pollokshields was the only Tory seat in Glasgow and it seemed we would never take it.""She also praised Roza Salih, the first refugee to be elected to Glasgow City Council.The 33-year-old SNP councillor for Greater Pollok has campaigned for the rights of refugees since she was a teenager when she helped form the Glasgow Girls protest group, which later inspired a BBC musical drama.In Glasgow's east end, the council's Scottish Conservatives leader Thomas Kerr retained his seat in Shettleston. He defied the odds to gain the seat in the deprived area in 2017, when he was a 20-year-old PR and advertising student. In that ward two Labour councillors were voted in at the expense of the SNP, which lost one of its two seats.'Rubbish in our streets,'Leader of the Glasgow Labour group Malcolm Cunning was voted in on first preference in the Linn ward.Mr Cunning said the results indicated the people of Glasgow were seeking change in their council, adding the city under the SNP's leadership had become a ""mess"".He said: ""I have seen throughout the election there is a particularly Glasgow phenomenon going on and that is about the state of the city. That is about the rubbish in our streets, bin collections missed, potholes, and simple mess that the city has developed over the last five years.""Anas Sarwar, leader of Scottish Labour and MSP for Glasgow Central, congratulated the new councillors, saying on Twitter: ""After a tough decade, finally a day to cheer.""The Scottish Green party took a record 10 seats in the election, including the city's first trans councillor.

But two Alba councillors, who had defected from SNP since the last election, were not re-elected and their seats were retaken by SNP candidates. Ward one in Inverclyde was one of only eight in Scotland that stood uncontested, and returned one candidate each for SNP, Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives.Labour group leader Stephen McCabe hopes to form another minority administration.North Ayrshire had no overall majority but keeps the SNP as the largest party despite two gains for the Tories. Arran returned its Conservative councillor with a 19% increase in support while the SNP vote dropped by 14%. BBC Scotland political editor Glen Campbell said this could reflect local concern over ferry services for the island.Political parties were also unable to gain an overall majority in the other councils in the West of Scotland.East Renfrewshire Council, which was run by an SNP/Labour/Independent administration, declared a close result, with the SNP taking six of 18 seats. Labour and the Conservatives each took five seats, a gain of two for Labour and a two-seat loss for the Conservatives. The SNP remains the largest group on Renfrewshire Council, up two to 21, with Labour also gaining two seats to take second place with 15.

But Lord Goldsmith has told the BBC the prime minister was ""wrong"".""I am happy to apologise for publicly sharing my views on the Privileges Committee,"" said Lord Goldsmith. ""I firmly believe our parliamentary democracy can only be strengthened by robust scrutiny, and parliamentarians should of course be free to be critical of its reports and proceedings. ""But as a minister I shouldn't have commented publicly. No 10 asked me to acknowledge that, and made clear that there was no question of my being 'sacked' if I did so. I was - and am - happy to do so.  ""My decision to step down has been a long time coming.""'Utterly betrayed' In a scathing resignation letter, which did not mention the Privileges Committee report, Lord Goldsmith said he had been ""horrified"" at the government abandoning its environmental commitments and withdrawing its leadership on the world stage. He cited a flagship animal welfare bill being ditched, as well as an abandoned pledge to spend £11.6bn of UK aid on climate and environment. Lord Goldsmith told BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt the pledge would not be met because of ""low levels of expenditure so far"", combined with a decision to classify spending on Afghan and Ukrainian refugees in the UK as overseas aid.Small island nations would be left ""feeling utterly betrayed,"" whilst ""our reputation as a reliable partner will simply be shredded,"" he added.However, in a letter to Lord Goldsmith, Mr Sunak said: ""You were asked to apologise for your comments about the Privileges Committee as we felt they were incompatible with your position as a Minister of the Crown. You have decided to take a different course.""He said Lord Goldsmith had been ""a vocal advocate of some of the most important issues that the UK and the world face today"". Mr Sunak added: ""The UK continues to play an important role globally in tackling climate change and preserving the environment.""It comes two days after a government climate watchdog warned the UK had lost its leadership on climate issues. As a minister in the Foreign Office, Lord Goldsmith had responsibility for Asia, energy, climate and the environment. Johnson allies interfered with Partygate probe - reportChris Mason: Free speech collides with committee doing its jobChancellor Jeremy Hunt said he did not agree with Lord Goldsmith's comments about Mr Sunak's attitude towards the environment.He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""I know the prime minister is as proud as I am that the UK has reduced our emissions by more than any other advanced economy. We have led the way when it comes to climate issues internationally.""But, he added, the government needed to get the economy ""back on track"" to be able to ""continue to invest at the rate we want to in the transition to net zero"".Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for Lord Goldsmith to resign after the Privilege Committee report's publication on Thursday. However, Mr Sunak's official spokesman had said the prime minister continued to have full confidence in him. Lib Dem spokeswoman Sarah Olney, who won her Richmond Park seat from Lord Goldsmith in 2019, said Mr Sunak ""should have had the guts"" to sack him. Ms Olney claimed his resignation confirmed the government ""doesn't give a damn about the environment and animal rights"".Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: ""Rishi Sunak's weakness is laid bare as 24 hours after he refused to condemn Zac Goldsmith, Goldsmith scathingly condemns him.""Former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, another close ally of Mr Johnson who was named in the Privileges Committee report, said Lord Goldsmith's ""passion"" for the environment was ""second to none"" and that the government had been ""lucky"" to have him. The committee's report said ""unprecedented and co-ordinated pressure"" was placed on its members, who were investigating whether former Prime Minister Mr Johnson had misled Parliament over lockdown parties at Downing Street. A tweet by Lord Goldsmith, in which he expressed support for the view that the inquiry was a ""witch hunt"" and a ""kangaroo court"", was cited in the report's evidence. However, other Tories named in the report accused the committee of trying to shut down freedom of speech. Getty ImagesLord Goldsmith is a close ally of Boris Johnson, who supported his 2016 London mayoral bidMr Johnson announced he was resigning as an MP days before the committee published its initial findings, branding the investigation a ""kangaroo court"".The year-long inquiry found Mr Johnson made multiple deliberately misleading statements to Parliament about lockdown parties at Downing Street.It ruled he should have been suspended for 90 days had he remained in the Commons.The sanction, which was lengthy by recent standards, would have been likely to trigger a by-election in Mr Johnson's constituency.Lord Goldsmith, a close ally of Mr Johnson, previously served as a junior environment minister in his government. He was made a peer by Mr Johnson after losing his seat as Conservative MP for Richmond Park to the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 general election.

He added that the government's apprenticeship levy, introduced in 2017, was ""not working"" and needed changing to give firms more flexibility. ""They have lost control of the economy, they have lost control of public services and now they have lost control of immigration,"" he added.He said if Mr Sunak were serious about ""weaning his government off the immigration lever"", then he would ""get serious about wages in Britain, and get serious about skills and training"".In reply, the prime minister said there was ""absolutely no semblance that that there would be any control"" over immigration under a Labour government.He accused Labour of wanting ""even more people coming to the UK"".Visa salary requirementsMeanwhile, Labour has promised to change the minimum salary levels for granting visas to foreign workers. In a statement released shortly after PMQs, the party said it would scrap a 20% reduction in the minimum salary required to get a visa for jobs on a government shortage occupation list. It did not say when it would make this change if it was in government, adding it would work with businesses to develop a timetable.It also said it would introduce new training requirements for ""key occupations"" on the shortage list. Thursday's migration figures are expected to reflect the effect of refugees coming from Ukraine since Russia's invasion, and a special visa scheme for Hong Kong residents to come to the UK.They will also reflect a change during Covid in how official migration figures are calculated, with projections now linked more to government data rather than surveys of passengers arriving at UK ports.Missed targets The Conservatives previously promised to bring net migration below 100,000 a year ahead of the 2015 and 2017 general elections. But they ditched the target ahead of the 2019 election, after repeatedly failing to meet it. Mr Sunak now says he wants to reduce immigration overall, but has declined to set a target of his own.Speaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, Transport Minister Richard Holden said it was ""absolutely right"" to say the Tories had failed on their target, and said they ""have to take more action"".When he campaigned to be Labour leader, Sir Keir promised to ""defend free movement as we leave the EU"". He now says the UK must end its ""dependency"" on immigration.Last week, party chair Anneliese Dodds said Labour wanted to see migration falling in the ""medium and long-term"". Labour, however, has also declined to set an overall target.Also appearing on Politics Live, shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said Labour would offer more training for jobs on the shortage occupation list.She added she could ""see no reason"" why overall migration levels should not have fallen by the end of Labour's five-year term of office, if it wins power at the next election.

"10 November 2017","Six figures to shape the Brexit battle","Six figures to shape the Brexit battle10 November 2017ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareEPAPrepare for eight days of jungle warfare in the Commons, as committee stage of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill begins.With 365 amendments and 74 new clauses (and the certainty of more to come), any number of rival factions manoeuvring for advantage, and very high stakes in the real world as well as in Westminster, this could - should - be historic.In theoretical command of the warring forces will be the ministers and shadow ministers - but so fluid is the politics around this bill that some of the most crucial units in this long battle will be bands of irregulars, often working across party lines on particular causes ranging from promoting an ultra-soft Brexit, to environmental protection to protecting the rights of children and child refugees. On the principle that no Conservative is going to touch an official Labour amendment, signed by Jeremy Corbyn, with a bargepole, but that Tory rebels will find it much more palatable to support an amendment from one of their own, the activities of these groups could be decisive. My impression is that the ""Soft Brexit""/Remain forces are a bit better organised than they were during the passage of the Article 50 Bill, early in 2017. Cross-party coordination is better, and the once rather grand establishment figures on the Tory Remain wing are now a little more schooled in the insurgent arts. And more than that, this is a bill that provides more opportunities for limited rebellion on distinct issues, which would not be seen as total treachery in the face of the enemy, by constituency associations and local voters. Could the government's majority be threatened? There are probably enough Labour Leavers to counterbalance the ""gang of nine"" Tory rebels, (Grieve, K Clarke, Soubry, Morgan, Sandbach, S Hammond, Wollaston, Lefroy and Neill) whose names appear on all the big amendments from the Conservative backbenches, so long as they do came out to vote with the government. But the question for the government whips is how many ""submarine"" rebels might be out there, biding their time and keeping a low profile.Part of the reason for the sheer number of amendments and new clauses raining down, is to tempt some of these bashful creatures. Quite consciously, different versions have been put down, to see which attract the most support; many will probably be discarded, as more popular expressions of a particular cause are identified. This is, as they say, an iterative process, and new amendments will doubtless continue to emerge.On the other side of the Brexit divide, the hardened band of backbench guerrillas who pushed for the referendum may soon be trying their hand at the unfamiliar arts of counter-insurgency…. Perhaps the arrival of government amendments 381-383, which write the date of Brexit Day onto the face of the bill, is intended to sooth Brexiteer jitters by ruling out any extension of negotiations and postponement of Brexit Day. Pro Brexit Tory backbenchers had been contemplating putting down an amendment of their own, if the government failed to do so....Meanwhile, here are some of the non-front-bench players who will come to the fore as the committee stage unfolds:Lindsay HoylePAAs Chairman of Ways and Means - the senior Deputy Speaker - he has a crucial role in shaping the debate, by selecting which of the 366 amendments and 74 new clauses will be discussed. And in particular, his rulings on which will require ""separate decision"", in other words a specific vote, will be very important for the many cross-party alliances seeking to write particular causes into the bill. At the moment, Mr Hoyle is heir apparent to Speaker Bercow…but this process could easily make him some dangerous enemies.Getty ImagesThe smart, cerebral former attorney general is the proposer of the amendments most likely to be made to the bill. He has several which have attracted an impressive range of signatures, including amendments 8, 9 and 10 which, in various ways, allow the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the general principles of EU law to continue to be used in UK courts to interpret retained EU law. The signature list on these - the gang of nine, plus Vince Cable, Stephen Kinnock, Patrick Grady, et al, reads like a who's who of the cross-party Remain alliance.Many of those names recur on amendments 1, 2, 5 and 15, which in different ways limit ministers' ability to change the law - 50 MPs have signed so far. That will come up on day three of the committee stage, which has not yet been scheduled. Dominic Grieve may have campaigned for Remain at the referendum, but there are plenty of Leave MPs who are nervous about giving sweeping powers to ministers and might support him on this issue. It's noticeable that the former Constitution Minister, John Penrose, a Remain supporter at the referendum, then a Leave convert and a member of the pro-Brexit European Research Group pops up as one of the signatories on several of his amendments.But the biggest amendment of all, is amendment 7 which would require Parliament to pass a bill approving the final terms of the withdrawal deal - the so-called ""Meaningful Vote"". This poses a challenge because it is signed by nine Conservatives, and has substantial real world effects - a bill could disrupt the government's timetable and worse, it would be amendable, for example to add a requirement for a further referendum. So that amendment could shatter the Conservatives' fragile unity. HoCAn influential backroom figure, Mr Walker chairs the Commons Procedure Select Committee, which has just published a report which recommends amending the bill to create a scrutiny structure or ""sifting committee"" to oversee the secondary legislation it will generate. With 40 years-worth of accumulated EU law to reprocess into British law, so that it remains effective after Brexit-day,  hundreds, perhaps thousands of statutory instruments will have to go through Parliament. In normal times few of these are controversial, and few are debated, but given the magnitude of some of the issues they will deal with, there are many backbenchers who want to ensure nothing major is slipped past Parliament on a one-off vote, without proper consideration. The Procedure Committee has proposed a new committee based on the Commons European Scrutiny Committee to examine each statutory instrument, put down under the bill, to determine if it was of sufficient political or legal importance to require further consideration by MPs. Ministers know they are vulnerable on this issue - and this recommendation may provide the cover for them to give ground, not least because what is proposed is not a Joint Committee, including peers, which would probably have meant no majority for the government. Mr Walker could be the decisive figure, because a lot of those who might support an amendment along those lines would take their cue from him; if he accepts reassurances from ministers, in one of those carefully choreographed Commons exchanges, then the issue could be finessed without a rebellion.The central figure in the Labour Remain underground - although there are plenty of other important players. This group have put down a battery of amendments to the bill on all kinds of issues, but it may be that their key role is to rally Labour support behind dissident Tory amendments, like Dominic Grieve's.As co-chair of the All Party Group on the EU, along with such luminaries as Anna Soubry (Con), Jo Swinson (LD) and Stephen Gethins (SNP), Mr Umunna can ringmaster cross-party alliances to amend the bill - and his efforts are at least tolerated and often encouraged by his party elders. In theory they want to defeat the government with their own amendments; in practice they know any defeat is destabilising for Theresa May, so they will doubtless wink at some arms-length collaboration with Tory rebels.HocWho? Why is a new Conservative backbencher from the 2017 intake on this list? Because he seems to be the central figure in the emerging Scottish Conservative caucus - ""Ruth Davidson's vicar in Westminster"", according to one Tory source. The Tartan Tories are a complicating factor in the debates to come. On the one hand, Theresa May only continues to govern because her party picked up a trove of Scottish seats at the last election. On the other, they exist in a rather different political environment to many of their colleagues - they can't afford to be seen as un-Scottish, or mere delegates of their Westminster leadership - and the Leader they really look to is named Ruth, not Theresa. They have to be able to deliver for their new constituencies and that may mean they take an ostentatiously independent line, at times. And that may apply in particular to the barrage of amendments dealing with the powers of devolved parliaments and assemblies.  This week, Professor Adam Tomkins, the Scottish Conservatives' constitution spokesman, suggests the legislation must recognise more powers coming to Scotland to avoid a Brexit ""power grab"" crisis. In an article for The Scotsman newspaper, he noted that there were 111 powers touching on devolved competence in Scotland which are currently exercised at EU level. Under the bill as introduced, all 111 would be held in Whitehall, at least to start with, with UK ministers releasing them to the devolved administrations over time. The Scottish Tories seem to be positioning themselves as the ""honest brokers"" between Westminster and the devolved Scottish and Welsh governments, to negotiate the handover of these powers - but that may entail significant amendments to the billThere's clearly a cross-party alliance of sorts on the devolution issues raised by the bill - quite a number of amendments are co-signed by Welsh Labour's Stephen Doughty, Scottish Labour's Ian Murray, the SNP's Stephen Gethins and Plaid's Hywel Williams, with regular appearances by such luminaries as Jo Swinson, Caroline Lucas, Ian Blackford, Tom Brake, Alistair Carmichael, Stephen Kinnock and others. Add some Scottish Tories to this list and suddenly there's real trouble for the government whips.House of CommonsNigel Dodds is the DUP's leader at WestminsterThe government's deal with the DUP provides its tenuous Commons majority - and the DUP are staunchly pro-Brexit, so that's all right then? Not entirely. Brexit raises some awkward issues on open borders with the Republic, on farm subsidies and, potentially, on new powers for the Northern Ireland Assembly (if and when it re-starts).  At the moment no DUP MP has signed any amendment to the Withdrawal Bill, and I expect any pressure to be exerted in privacy, in the sure and certain knowledge that the government will need the DUP's 10 votes at regular intervals throughout the passage of this bill.In this context, keep an eye on one of the latest wave of proposed changes to the bill, New Clause 70, proposed by the Independent Unionist, Lady Hermon, with strong SNP and backbench Labour support. This seeks to enshrine the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in the bill, preventing ministers in Westminster or Stormont from exercising the powers it will give them in breach of those principles.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-41945959"

"15 January 2023","Suella Braverman confronted by Holocaust survivor over 'invasion' rhetoric","Suella Braverman confronted by Holocaust survivor over 'invasion' rhetoric15 January 2023ShareShareGetty ImagesSuella Braverman was reappointed as home secretary in OctoberThe home secretary has said she will not apologise for her language, after a Holocaust survivor criticised her for describing migrants as an ""invasion"". Joan Salter, 83, confronted Suella Braverman during a meeting in her Fareham constituency on Friday. She said the home secretary's rhetoric reminded her of the language the Nazis used to justify murdering her family. But Ms Braverman said her language demonstrated the ""scale of the problem"" with illegal migration. In footage of the exchange, provided by the charity Freedom from Torture, Ms Salter said: ""When I hear you using words against refugees like 'swarms' and an 'invasion', I am reminded of the language used to dehumanise and justify the murder of my family and millions of others.""Why do you find the need to use that kind of language?""Ms Braverman thanked Ms Salter for her question and said she ""shared a huge amount of concern and sympathy"" over the ""challenge"" of illegal immigration. She said her own parents were not born in Britain and ""owe everything to this country"". However, she added: ""There is a huge problem that we have right now when it comes to illegal migration, the scale of which we have not known before.""I won't apologise for the language that I have used to demonstrate the scale of the problem.""Ms Braverman's answer was applauded by the audience. UK is compassionate, says PM after invasion rowMinister: We must be careful with migrant languageThe Home Office said a one-minute video of the incident, shared by Freedom from Torture on social media, was ""heavily edited and doesn't reflect the full exchange"". ""Since the footage misrepresents the interaction about a sensitive area of policy, we have asked the organisation who posted the video to take it down,"" a spokesman said. However, the charity's chief executive, Sonya Sceats, said it would not remove the short clip from social media, adding that a video of the full exchange was available on the charity's website. ""Suella Braverman refused to apologise for offensive and dehumanising language when challenged by a Holocaust survivor at a party meeting,"" Ms Sceats said. ""She has used language she should be ashamed of, and we won't be pressured into helping her hide it.""Shortly after being reappointed as home secretary in October, Ms Braverman referred to her job as being ""about stopping the invasion on our southern coast"", in reference to the number of people crossing the English Channel in small boats. Ms Braverman has not used the word ""swarm"" publicly but it has been used by other politicians including the then-prime minister David Cameron and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Ms Salter, who has been recognised with an MBE for her work on Holocaust education, was born Fanny Zimetbaum in 1940 in Brussels to Polish Jewish parents. When she was three months old Belgium was invaded by the Nazis and she escaped to France with her mother and sister. She was later taken by the Red Cross to the US in 1943 before being reunited with her parents in 1947 in London, where she has lived since.UK is compassionate, says PM after invasion rowMinister: We must be careful with migrant languageSuella BravermanImmigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64282961"

"21 March 2024","Rwanda flights: Lords inflict further defeats on government","Rwanda flights: Lords inflict further defeats on government21 March 2024ShareBecky MortonBBC political reporterShareGetty ImagesThe House of Lords has inflicted fresh defeats on the government over its flagship Rwanda bill, meaning further delay to it becoming law.Seven proposed changes, including a provision to ensure ""due regard"" for domestic and international law, were passed by peers.The bill will now return to the Commons, but not until after Easter.The legislation aims to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.It declares the east African country is safe, after deportation flights were stalled by the Supreme Court ruling the government's plan could lead to human rights breaches.The scheme is central to the prime minister's pledge to ""stop the boats"" as it seeks to deter people from making the dangerous journey across the Channel. What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Labour's proposals on domestic and international law were passed by 271 to 228 votes.Opposing the amendment, Home Office Minister Lord Sharpe insisted there was nothing in the bill which conflicts with the UK's international obligations. Meanwhile, peers also supported a proposal put forward by crossbench peer Lord Hope that Rwanda only be deemed a safe country once a treaty bringing in new safeguards has been fully implemented. The amendment passed by 285 to 230 votes. Another change to exempt individuals who have supported the UK armed forces overseas from deportation to Rwanda, which was proposed by Labour peer Lord Browne, was passed by 248 to 209 votes. The bill must now return to the Commons in a process known as ""ping pong"", where it is batted between the two Parliamentary chambers until they can agree the final wording. This is now expected to happen after MPs return from their Easter break on 15 April, according to a senior government source.Labour's Home Affairs spokesman Lord Coaker said the party had no intention of blocking the bill completely. However, a delay could threaten Downing Street's ambition to get the first flights off the ground this spring. No 10 officials insist that even if the legislation is not passed until after Easter, their target date can still be met. On Monday, MPs voted down 10 amendments to the draft law proposed by peers earlier this month and they are likely to again reject any further changes put forward in the House of Lords. Home Office Minister Michael Tomlinson has described the proposals put forward by peers as ""wrecking amendments"".Ahead of the Lords debate, Home Secretary James Cleverly urged peers to allow the bill to pass. ""The more this bill progresses, the more worried Labour get that, as we've always said, it will work and the more we've anticipated deliberate efforts from Labour to delay, disrupt or sabotage the scheme,"" he told the Daily Express. ""We remain focused on not letting that happen, and hope their lordships recognise it's time to let this bill pass so we can continue to stop the boats, and save lives.""Labour's Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the Rwanda scheme was ""a failing farce"". ""If the Conservatives were ready to implement this, they would be bringing the bill back to complete the remaining stages next week and get on with it,"" she said.""But because their plans aren't ready, they've decided to delay the bill as well, so they can try to blame everyone else for the chaos they have created, and the fact that they haven't got a proper plan."" Labour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins power, even if flights take off before the next general election. However, asked if any individuals already sent to the country would be returned to the UK under a Labour government, a party spokesman said they would not, adding: ""If the scheme is up and running you have to accept the decisions the government has already made.""Lords inflict more defeats on Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68618570"

""What I'm not comfortable with is 50,000 a year deciding that they can come into this country without any restrictions, paying money to people smugglers, putting themselves at risk.""More immigration not a Brexit betrayal, says HuntAsked if he supported the previous Conservative manifesto commitment of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, he replied: ""Personally, I'm quite pragmatic about it - I don't mind highly-skilled people who've got something to contribute coming to Britain.""Meanwhile, the UK government has faced calls to provide greater rail funding to Wales as a result of the HS2 high-speed rail line since not an inch of track is set to be laid in Wales.It is classified as an England and Wales project by Westminster, meaning the Welsh government does not receive a proportionate amount of money, something which is known as a top-up Barnett consequential.Analysis by the UK government estimates HS2 will have an overall negative impact on Wales.Officials in Westminster have made the case that the proposed Birmingham to Crewe leg of HS2 would benefit passengers in north Wales.Asked if a two-year delay to the Crewe leg made it harder to justify this argument, Mr Davies said: ""The reality is that Wales and England will benefit from rail projects that are going across the border. ""The work that's going on in the Forest of Dean will mainly benefit passengers travelling from south Wales, traveling up to the Midlands or even up to north Wales.""Siemens/ PAHS2 trains are expected to be 400m-long (1,300ft) with as many as 1,100 seatsThe Welsh government and opposition parties in the Senedd, including the Welsh Conservatives, have called for extra HS2 rail funding for Wales.But in an interview with WalesOnline, UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer refused to commit to making the change if in power in Westminster.Welsh government Finance Minister Rebecca Evans told Politics Wales she would continue ""to press our colleagues in the UK Labour party on HS2"".Mr Starmer also refused to make spending promises on the Welsh NHS ahead of the next general election, but Ms Evans said she was ""absolutely confident they will be providing excellent ideas in terms of tax and spending"".On the issue of TikTok, Mr Davies said he was ""stumped"" over whether he should continue using it. He said he recognised its usefulness in communicating with younger voters while acknowledging UK government's security fears. Ministers in Westminster and their counterparts in the Senedd have been banned from using it on work phones amid fears data could be accessed by the Chinese government.He said: ""I'm going to take a bit of advice because on the one hand, I want to make sure that if young people are getting their news from TikTok then I'm there, but on the other hand, I totally recognise the issues that the government raise.""TikTok has denied it hands user data to the Chinese government.More immigration not a Brexit betrayal, says HuntUK net migration hits all-time record at 504,000New 'simple' UK immigration system launchesWalesUK immigrationDavid DaviesHS2Welsh governmentRebecca EvansMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-65007855"
"18 April 2022","Rwanda asylum critics have no solutions, says Patel","Rwanda asylum critics have no solutions, says Patel18 April 2022ShareJoseph Lee & Doug FaulknerBBC NewsShareReutersPriti Patel and Rwanda Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta said their plan was ""bold and innovative""Home Secretary Priti Patel has hit back at critics of the government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, saying they have failed to offer solutions.Writing in the Times with the Rwandan foreign minister, she said they had proposed an innovative answer to the ""deadly trade"" of people-smuggling.No ""humanitarian nation"" could allow that suffering to continue, they said.It comes after Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said there were ""serious ethical questions"" about the plan.To push the scheme through, Ms Patel issued a ministerial direction - meaning she took responsibility for the policy - after her top civil servant questioned whether it offered value for money.Ms Patel and Vincent Biruta, Rwanda's foreign minister, said the global asylum system was ""collapsing"" under the strain of humanitarian crises and human trafficking.The plan to transport some asylum seekers who enter the UK unlawfully to Rwanda, where they can apply to settle, will allow people fleeing persecution to find safety, they said.And they added that the UK's investment in Rwanda - an initial £120m - would help to address the lack of opportunities which drive economic migration.No evidence Rwanda plan deters migrants - adviserHow might the Rwanda asylum plan work?UK's Rwanda asylum plan ungodly, says Archbishop""We are taking bold and innovative steps and it's surprising that those institutions that criticise the plans fail to offer their own solutions,"" they wrote.""Allowing this suffering to continue is no longer an option for any humanitarian nation.""It also emerged that some refugees in Rwanda will be sent to the UK under the terms of the two nations' agreement.A UK government source told the BBC that it would be supporting Rwanda to resettle ""a portion of the most vulnerable refugees"".The scheme will initially focus mainly on single men arriving in the UK on small boats or lorries. Those sent to Rwanda will be provided with accommodation while their asylum claims are considered.If successful they will be able to remain in the east African nation.Energy minister Greg Hands told Times Radio sending migrants to Rwanda would be a ""significant deterrent"" to people attempting to cross the Channel in small boats. He said the government was ""confident"" that the policy would work.Two boats carrying 76 people were brought into Dover, Kent, on Sunday, the Home Office said, while a further two small boats were seen being brought ashore on Monday.1:13Justin Welby addresses the ""serious ethical questions"" of sending asylum seekers to RwandaOn Easter Sunday, Mr Welby became the latest figure to criticise the plan, accusing the government of ""subcontracting our responsibilities"" and saying it cannot ""stand the judgment of God"".He was joined by the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, who said the policy was ""depressing and distressing"", adding: ""We can do better than this.""Opposition parties and some Conservative MPs have also criticised the plan, while more than 160 charities and campaign groups called it ""shamefully cruel"" and urged the prime minister and Ms Patel to scrap it.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the scheme as ""unworkable"", while the Liberal Democrats said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees and the SNP's Ian Blackford called it ""absolutely chilling"".Among their concerns was Rwanda's own human rights record, with the UK having raised allegations of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and torture in the east African nation at the UN last year.But in their Times article, Ms Patel and Mr Biruta said Rwanda ""ranks as one of the world's safest countries"" and has already accommodated 130,000 refugees from multiple countries.Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas?Analysis: Rwanda deal does what no country has done beforeLand of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinionWhile they said the plan would ""deter migrants from putting their lives at risk"" by making dangerous journeys, a letter from the Home Office's top official said evidence for a deterrent effect was ""highly uncertain"".Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft warned the policy had a high cost and would only be value for money if it reduced the number of Channel crossings and other illegal entries to the UK.While the UK is investing £120m into the ""economic development and growth of Rwanda"" as part of the deal, the government said funding would also be provided to support asylum operations, accommodation and integration which would be ""similar to the costs incurred in the UK for these services"". The Times has reported a cost of £20,000 to £30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda.Labour's Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""highly unusual"" in the Home Office for a ministerial direction to be issued.She said if a policy is drawn up ""at the last minute"" it can be difficult to prove its monetary value but as the idea of processing asylum seekers abroad had been discussed by the government for some time, she said she would be interested to see the ""accounting for it"".'YOU ONLY WANTED ONE THING: TO LIVE': How one remarkable German football fan survived the HolocaustBRITAIN IS FEELING THE SQUEEZE: Coping with the cost of living crisisNo evidence Rwanda plan deters migrants - adviserUK's Rwanda asylum plan ungodly, says ArchbishopPatel personally approved Rwanda plan amid concernsUK immigrationImmigrationPriti PatelRefugees and asylum seekersRwandaArchbishop of Canterbury","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61137081"

The Taliban have promised the rights of women in Afghanistan will be respected ""within the framework of Islamic law"".But the home secretary said the group had a history of oppressing women and ""that's not going to change overnight"".""I genuinely do not think that we should be at all believing the spokespeople or the PR operation that we're currently seeing,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. VOICES: Uncertain times ahead for Afghan womenEXPLAINER: Ten days that shook AfghanistanAT THE SCENE: Kabul hotel - Taliban guards, no womenAppearing on BBC Breakfast, Ms Patel refused to give a timescale for how long it would take for the 20,000 Afghans to be brought to the UK. However, she compared the new scheme to one introduced for Syrian refugees, which saw a similar number of people resettled over a period of seven years. ""We could end up bringing many more [than 20,000] but first of all we have to have the underpinning and the infrastructure and the support to do that,"" she said. She said a target of 5,000 in the first year was ""deliverable"", adding: ""It would be terrible quite frankly to bring people and not be able to give them the support that they would need in terms of accommodation, resettlement and giving them the opportunity to build a new life in the UK.""Downing Street also said the 5,000 figure was ""not a hard cap"" but based on expectations of how many people would be able to leave over that time period. Asked how the UK would get vulnerable people, who may not feel safe leaving their homes, out of Afghanistan, Ms Patel said ministers would work with third party agencies, humanitarian organisations and other governments, including the US and Canada. She added that people could also be resettled from neighbouring countries, as well as Afghanistan itself. Meanwhile, Parliament has been recalled and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating MPs about the situation in Afghanistan.He said the government would be doing everything it can to support those who have helped the UK mission in Afghanistan and to ""avert a humanitarian crisis"". Ministers have been rushing to put this scheme together in response to the situation in Afghanistan, with the final details signed off on Tuesday.Information on how to apply is expected soon. The scheme is loosely based on the one introduced during the Syrian war, which also saw 20,000 move to the UK from 2014 to 2021.But ministers acknowledge the practicalities of getting people out of Afghanistan will be considerably more complicated because of the extent of Taliban control. Government insiders don't know the extent to which the new regime will allow people to flee if they so choose. There will be funding for the resettlement programme - and the government will work with local councils and devolved governments on where to house Afghans who come to the UK.The scheme has faced criticism from opposition parties and some Conservative MPs. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Defence Select Committee, told the Daily Mirror it was a ""woefully inadequate response"", citing the government only aiming to help 5,000 refugees in the first year when ""the threat is at its greatest"".Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the target of resettling 20,000 Afghans was ""too small"" and had been ""plucked out of the air"". Lib Dems foreign affairs spokeswoman Layla Moran agreed that ""20,000 should be the starting point of this scheme, not the target"".Refugee charities welcomed the announcement as a positive first step but said the timeframe was too slow and eligibility for asylum should be expanded. 1:51Afghan interpreter: ""I'm so worried about my parents and my sisters' safety""Among those hoping they might get help to leave Afghanistan through the scheme is a former teacher in Kandahar. The 21-year-old woman - who the BBC is not naming to protect her safety - fled for Kabul after the Taliban captured Kandahar but said she was now too afraid to leave the house. ""I was working with an educational organisation - the Taliban, they do not accept these things,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now I do not feel safe at all... I'm just like a prisoner in the house now.""She said Afghans needed help to escape now - and if she had to wait years for help it may be too late. ""We are in the situation that we cannot guarantee our lives for tomorrow,"" she said. ""Will I be alive tomorrow? We cannot guarantee that.""ReutersAn RAF plane arrived at Brize Norton on Tuesday as part of UK efforts to evacuate people from AfghanistanThe new plan is on top of an existing scheme for interpreters and other Afghans who have worked for the UK government - the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP). Some 5,000 Afghans and their family members will come to the UK via that scheme this year. Nearly 2,000 have arrived since 22 June.The UK has already sent about 900 troops to Afghanistan to help evacuate British nationals and Afghans who are eligible to resettle in the UK.Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said seven more planes were being sent to Kabul and the UK hoped to fly out 1,000 more people on Wednesday. He told the BBC that British forces were collaborating with the Taliban, who were providing security around Kabul's airport. Sir Nick said the Taliban seemed prepared to allow people to leave the country at the moment but ""we need to be clear that this is only possible if they behave in a reasonable fashion"".

"3 November 2022","Rishi Sunak to review leadership campaign pledges","Rishi Sunak to review leadership campaign pledges3 November 2022ShareShareReutersRishi Sunak will review the pledges he made during his summer Tory leadership campaign, No 10 has said.     The prime minister will examine ""whether now is the right time to bring them forward,"" his spokeswoman said.Mr Sunak lost to Liz Truss in a ballot of Tory members - but was selected to replace her by Tory MPs when her premiership fell apart.He announced dozens of policies during his summer campaign, including tax cuts.But his spokeswoman said the economic ""context"" had changed since the promises were made.""We need to take some time to make sure what is deliverable and what is possible,"" she added. Unlike his summer campaign, Mr Sunak did not make any policy pledges during the four-day contest to replace Ms Truss as prime minister last month.PM backtracks on £10 missed NHS appointment finesWhich policies will Sunak stick with or twist?  Treasury warns of tax rises to fill financial holeHis earlier campaign promises included pledges to scrap the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills, and to lower the basic rate of income tax from 20% to 16% before the end of the next parliament.Mr Sunak also promised to keep April's 1.25p in the pound rise to National Insurance - currently due to be reversed on Sunday in the wake of Ms Truss's mini-budget in September.He also pledged to place an annual cap on the number of refugees the UK accepts, tighten asylum qualification criteria, and withhold aid from countries that won't take migrant returns.At Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak sought to reassure his backbenchers that migration was a ""priority"" for him, as he faced questions over the government's record on asylum claims.  Afterwards the PM's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak remained ""committed to the sentiment"" of his migration pledges, but confirmed they would form part of the review.Other summer leadership pledges included:eliminating one-year hospital waiting times by September 2024preventing solar panels being installed on ""our best farmland""banning strikes in essential public servicesblocking new smart motorways, where technology is used to regulate traffic flow The prime minister has already abandoned his campaign pledge to fine patients in England £10 if they miss GP or hospital appointments.He has also restored the ban on shale gas fracking in England that was lifted by Ms Truss. During the summer, he said he supported fracking where projects had local consent. The policy review comes as Mr Sunak and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt consider tax increases and spending cuts ahead of a budget on 17 November.Ahead of the statement, the Treasury has been warning that across-the-board tax increases will be required to ensure the government meets its medium-term targets on spending and debt.Reports have suggested Mr Hunt could extend a freeze on income tax thresholds, as well as the windfall tax on oil and gas firms.Downing Street is seeking to make the case its outlook now is a pragmatic one.They have unexpectedly inherited high office in the blink of an eye and the teeth of economic calamity, and they're pausing to work out what on earth to do next.After Liz Truss's ""shock and awe"" blitz of policy announcements rapidly became the awe and shock for her of them imploding, the new PM and cabinet are seeking to make a virtue of stepping rather tentatively, rather gingerly.But that means, right now at least, we know very little in concrete, specific terms about what the government wants to do, let alone will do.Read more from ChrisMinisters have also not ruled out real-terms cuts to pensions and benefits by raising them below the rate of inflation, a move that could save billions.The government is considering delaying the introduction of a £86,000 lifetime cap on social care costs due to apply in England from October 2023, a government source told the BBC.The plan includes a more generous means-test for people applying to their local council for financial support. Groups representing local authorities have been calling for a delay to the introduction of the cap, with warnings of acute staffing and financial pressures on services.Sir Andrew Dilnot, the architect of a previous cap that was abandoned in 2017, said it would be ""astonishing"" if the government did delay the cap. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One it might save money in ""the very short term"" - but would make no difference to the public finances in the long term if it was eventually applied anyway.

Scotland's electoral map gives you a pretty good idea of who has won the election - it is swathed in SNP yellow. But look closely and you can see why they fell just short of an outright majority.The seats they failed to win are islands in regions otherwise dominated by the SNP, meaning it was all but impossible for them to win seats back from the regional list, in the swings and roundabouts of the Holyrood system.Two of the constituencies they did gain, in Ayr and East Lothian, were in a region where they already had list seats, two of which were subsequently lost.The small strongholds that other parties have scattered across Scotland ultimately proved decisive.The fact the SNP did not win a majority will make a real difference to the next five years at Holyrood. A minority government needs support from other parties to pass budgets and all its major reforms. If it had been a majority, we could have put every other manifesto in the bin and taken the SNP's manifesto to be the definitive guide to the term ahead.The Scottish Greens in particular - who were the SNP's partner of choice last term - will be looking forward to potentially having some of their policy priorities passed in return for crucial votes.It also means the SNP will not have a majority on any Holyrood committee, meaning their legislation will not necessarily sail through the parliament with ease.The Scottish Conservatives retained their position in second place in a vindication of the party's strategy to target the ""peach vote"" - the colour of the regional list ballot paperThere were initially some nerves that they might have neglected the ""lilac"" constituency vote, but they ultimately held their key seats with the help of transfers from other pro-union parties.Tactical voting may have had a huge impact overall - every seat seems to have become a race between the SNP and the party that was judged most likely to beat them locally.Labour - the party which may have the most to do to come up with a convincing answer to the constitutional question - finds itself marooned in third place again.The Lib Dems meanwhile have slumped to just four seats due to their failure to pick anything up from the regional lists.They have a number of strongholds in different parts of Scotland, but these are so tightly focused that the party's constituency wins in those areas make it very hard for them to pick up list seats too.In an election of continuity, there was one surprise result which was quite different from previous years - turnout.Some 63% of the electorate came out to vote, a full ten percentage points above the average for previous Holyrood polls.It is hard to say exactly why this happened, but a number of factors will likely have been at play. The rise in postal vote registrations could be one, as could the expansion of the franchise to new groups including refugees.And the pandemic may have ultimately boosted turnout, rather than held it down, as many had predicted.People might have had more time to engage with activists or go out to vote due to lockdown.Indeed lockdown itself may have encouraged some to vote, having been a very clear example of the powers that governments can exercise.Holyrood's diverse representation had somewhat stalled in recent years - but that has all changed now.The class of 2021 includes a record number of 58 female MSPs. The SNP now has 34 women, Labour have 10, the Conservatives have eight, the Scottish Greens have five and the Lib Dems have one female MSP.It has chiefly been driven by the SNP's policy of having all-women shortlists for many seats where male MSPs were retiring - meaning a lot of older male MSPs have effectively been replaced by younger women.Among those are the first women of colour elected to Holyrood, the SNP's Kaukab Stewart and Pam Gosal of the Scottish Tories.Labour's Pam Duncan-Glancy became the first wheelchair user returned to Holyrood, in what may be the most diverse parliament to date.

"8 November 2023","Oxford LTNs: Conservative motion to remove LTNs fails","Oxford LTNs: Conservative motion to remove LTNs fails8 November 2023ShareShareOCCLTNs prevent traffic taking shortcuts through residential areasA Conservative councillor's motion to remove low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) has been defeated.Liam Walker called for Oxfordshire County Council's cabinet to ""urgently consider"" getting rid of the LTNs in Cowley, Oxford.But an amendment by Labour's Duncan Enright called for the authority to ""remove the congestion"" around the LTNs, instead of the LTNs themselves.The amendment was voted through at the full council meeting.LTNs prevent traffic taking shortcuts through residential areas and are intended to make streets safer for walking and cycling.They have prompted protests, with bollards run over, burned and stolen.Mr Walker asked councillors ""to take back control of this complete and utter LTN mess"" and ""right the wrongs"" of a ""failed"" experiment.""Start standing up for the local businesses, the local bus companies, and for the residents who have been ignored by the coalition cabinet,"" he added.'Genuinely sad'But Mr Enright said: ""It's congestion we should eliminate and the LTNs may need to change significantly... but to focus on one particular measure in isolation like LTNs is to misunderstand the whole problem altogether.""Liberal Democrat Andrew Gant, cabinet member for highway management, said he was ""genuinely sad"" the Tory party had ""nothing to offer"", as a solution.He added: ""If we've managed to do something that's upset Rishi Sunak, Piers Corbyn, Councillor Walker, Laurence Fox and King Arthur Pendragon, then we're obviously doing something right.""LTNs have prompted protests in OxfordEarlier in the meeting, local residents had their say on the ongoing debate.Anne Stares said there was ""no point"" in ""appealing to the Lib Dem/Green dictators… trying to gaslight an entire city"".She said the ""evil"" LTNs had caused ""misery and hardship"".""Will you save our lives or will you keep us on this LTN-filled road to hell?"" she asked.Abby White, who has limited sight, said: ""Navigating our streets presents daily challenges, but LTNs have significantly improved my experience, and I do feel very invested in their future. ""Road safety is a matter of life and death.""The LTNs on Divinity Road, St. Clement's, and St. Mary's were made permanent last month.LTNs on Littlemore Road, Littlehay Road, and Crescent Road were made permanent following an 18-month trial last year.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

"22 April 2022","Scotland's papers: New Partygate probe and Tory rebellion","Scotland's papers: New Partygate probe and Tory rebellion22 April 2022ShareShareSeveral newspapers including the Scotsman are leading with the decision by MPs to launch an inquiry into whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties in Downing Street.The Telegraph reports Mr Johnson has said he has ""nothing to hide"" over the fresh Partygate investigation. It says the PM made an ""about turn"" over plans to block it after Tory MPs rebelled amid fears it would cost them at the local elections.""The gig is up, Boris"", is the Metro's headline - repeating a call from Conservative MP Steve Baker for the prime minister to resign. The paper says the influential backbencher, who had originally praised Mr Johnson's ""humble"" apology, later accused the PM of an ""orgy of adulation"" at a gathering of Tory backbenchers.The Times reports that ministers were on the ""brink of quitting"" before the government changed course. The paper says at least six members of the government had told whips they would not support the plans to block the Labour Party's motion to launch an inquiry, describing the row as a ""revolt of middle ranks"" which forced the ""humiliating climbdown"".The new investigation will have ""power to demand photos"" from parties in No 10, reports the i. The paper quotes a Tory MP who criticises No 10's ""shambolic"" U-turn, saying it has made the party look like ""idiots"" and claiming the fault lies with the PM, rather than the party whips.The Herald notes that the PM has vowed to lead the Tories into the next election despite the Partygate row. The PM has insisted Mr Johnson has said he has ""absolutely nothing, frankly, to hide"".The Record says the party has finally turned on the PM, when he is away on what the paper calls a ""jolly"" to India. On Friday he will discuss defence and energy ties with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.And the Daily Star has picked up the row between Donald Trump, Nigel Farage and broadcaster Piers Morgan over an interview between the presenter and the former US president.

"1 July 2022","What's happening in Parliament this week?","What's happening in Parliament this week?1 July 2022ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareReutersIt's going to be a testing week for the government and the prime minister - with Boris Johnson facing a statement to MPs on his string of international summits, and what promises to be an awkward PMQs.And there's his appearance on Wednesday before the Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, with the focus on the impact of the war in Ukraine on the UK, the government's response to the rising cost of living, integrity in politics and the rule of law. There will also be some new faces in the government, after the post-by-election departure of Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden and the abrupt resignation of Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher. Kelly Tolhurst is the new deputy chief whip - a vital cog in any government's parliamentary machine, marshalling the troops and heading off rebellions - and that role is critical given the visible disaffection of many Tory MPs and the number of difficult votes to come. PA MediaMr Pincher was a highly effective operator in the whips' office - and Ms Tolhurst will need to be too.In that context, the pre-summer parliamentary calendar is beginning to look a little congested. In the next few weeks the Commons will polish off the details of the Northern Ireland Legacy and Reconciliation Bill (with its controversial proposals for immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate in revealing the truth of historical violence). And later the whole House yomps through three committee stage days and a day of report on the even more contentious Northern Ireland Protocol Bill. This could get interesting because there might just be a majority for a well-designed non-government amendment - but ministers clearly want the bill through the Commons before the summer recess begins on 21 July. Meanwhile their lordships have the far from uncontroversial Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill. And lurking in the background is the prospect of spending legislation to keep government in Northern Ireland ticking over in the continuing absence of the devolved institutions. On top of that there's fast-track legislation due to implement the government's windfall tax on energy companies. Nerd point: this will be introduced via a ""ways and means resolution"", to be voted on, on Tuesday, paving the way for the actual bill to be considered on Monday 8 July.PACEMAKERHere's my rundown of the week ahead: On Monday expect the usual post-weekend batch of government statements and urgent questions, quite possibly including the PM reporting back on his travels. The main business is detailed scrutiny of the Northern Ireland Troubles Legacy and Reconciliation Bill.There's an intriguing adjournment debate led by Conservative Alexander Stafford, who will argue for more teaching of English medieval history in schools - he says pupils are more likely to learn about Martin Luther King than Alfred the Great. Assisted dying In Westminster Hall, there's what may prove to be a significant Petitions Committee debate, on e-petition 604383, which urges the government to bring forward legislation to allow assisted dying for adults who are terminally ill and have mental capacity. Supporters will be hoping to show that the balance of opinion in Parliament has tilted their way since the defeat of Rob Marris's private member's bill in 2015 - and pushing for a route to take the issue forward, perhaps via a health select committee inquiry. The main debates on Tuesday and Wednesday are on Estimates Day motions to approve government spending. In theory this is how the Commons keeps control of the public purse strings; in practice MPs debate a series of select committee reports chosen by the Liaison Committee, and the actual votes to approve spending are pretty much a ritual rubber stamping of the government's plans.Tuesday's subjects are the Department for Work and Pensions' spending on cost of living measures, supporting the Welsh economy, and the spending of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on climate change and decarbonisation. Wednesday's debates will be on Department for Education spending (Education Committee Chair Robert Halfon will raise concerns about the 100,000 ""ghost children"" who've disappeared from schools in England since the start of the pandemic) and on Foreign Office spending on international development. Online safety Thursday opens with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport questions - listen carefully for the tone of questions about the government's landmark attempt to regulate the internet, the Online Safety Bill. It's facing a difficult report stage, caught between MPs who regard the bill as unworkable and inimical to free speech, and others who think it does not go far enough. Day one of that report stage is pencilled in for Tuesday 12 July.The main debates will be on Backbench Business Committee motions on resources for enforcement of the Economic Crime Act and a general debate on alcohol taxation, feeding into a current government review. Committee highlights include the Housing Minister Eddie Hughes before the Levelling Up Committee (Monday) in its inquiry into exempt accommodation (accommodation for homeless people, abuse victims, prison leavers and recovering addicts). There are concerns about standards of accommodation, and with the senior Conservative on the committee Bob Blackman promising a private member's bill to regulate the sector, the evidence will doubtless feed into his his proposed new law. Defence (Tuesday) questions Secretary of State Ben Wallace on the recommendations of its report, We're going to need a bigger Navy.Public Accounts (Wednesday) has recalled civil servants from the Levelling Up department to talk about a range of housing issues from cladding to house-building targets. These recalls normally betray some unhappiness with earlier answers.  Lords hours In the Lords, peers have their share of the current spate of Northern Ireland legislation, with report stage consideration of the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill on Wednesday. Fresh from forcing a substantial rewrite of the Schools Bill, to stop a ""power grab"" over the running of academies, peers may be in assertive mood.There's also a debate on whether to change their lordships' sitting hours so that they sit at 13:00 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, normally rising by 20:30. At the moment they open at 14:30 on Tuesdays and 15:00 on Wednesdays - a relic of the days when the Law Lords delivered their judgements in the chamber on a Wednesday afternoon. The vote won't be whipped and it looks hard to call, with most Conservatives apparently against, most Lib Dems for, and a spectrum of views across the Labour and crossbench groups. The continuing parliamentary interest around river pollution resurfaces with a debate on the impacts of sewage disposal rates in UK rivers and the responsibility of water companies to alleviate these impacts, led by Lib Dem Lord Oates. And the Upper House private member's bill season opens (Friday) with second reading debates on five bills proposed by individual peers - Green Party peer Baroness Jones's Clean Air (Human Rights) Bill; Conservative Lord Farmer's Front-loaded Child Benefit Bill (an interesting proposal to enable parents to receive a higher rate during a child's early years and a reduced rate later on); the Bishop of Durham's Universal Credit (Removal of Two Child Limit) Bill; Lib Dem Baroness Ludford's Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill; and independent peer Lord Mann's Local Authority (Housing Allocation) Bill, which would scrap nationally set targets for house-building in each council area.

"5 December 2023","Changes to UK visa requirements: Key points at-a-glance","Changes to UK visa requirements: Key points at-a-glance5 December 2023ShareShareGetty ImagesThe government has unveiled a package of measures to reduce the number of people coming to the UK. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the changes, which are due to take effect from next spring, would deliver the biggest ever cut in net migration. Tougher visa rules unveiled in plan to cut migrationIt comes after net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving - reached a record 745,000 last year.Minimum salary for UK skilled worker visa to increaseTo be eligible for a skilled worker visa to come to the UK, your job offer must meet a minimum salary requirement. At the moment this is whichever is highest out of £26,200 per year, £10.75 per hour or the ""going rate"" for your job. From next spring, this will rise to £38,700 per year.However, crucially health and care workers - who account for almost half of people on work visas - will be exempt from the increase. People on national pay scales, such as teachers, will also be exempt. The Migration Observatory says the main impact is likely to be on middle-skilled jobs like butchers or chefs, where pay tends to be less than £30,000. Minimum income requirement for family visa to riseThe minimum income required for British citizens who want to bring a foreign family member or partner to live with them in the UK is rising from £18,600 to £38,700 a year. An estimated 70,000 people came to the UK on family visas in the year ending June 2023.As the change affects those on lower incomes, it will have a bigger impact on groups who tend to earn less, such as women, younger people and those living outside London and south-east England. Ban on care workers bringing family dependants to the UKOverseas care workers will no longer be able to bring their partner or children with them to the UK. Home Office data suggest health and care workers are more likely to be joined by family members than people on other work visas. In the year to September, more than 101,000 visas were issued to care workers, with an estimated 120,000 visas granted to associated dependants. Care companies are worried the ban on dependants will put off potential recruits from coming to the UK, making staff shortages worse.But the government says it believes there will still be high demand from overseas workers for care roles in the UK, even if individuals cannot bring family members with them. What impact might migration changes have on the care sector? Getty ImagesSalary discount for shortage occupation list scrappedCurrently jobs on a shortage occupation list can be paid at 80% of the usual going rate to qualify for a skilled worker visa. The list covers a wide range of sectors including health, education, care work and construction and is designed to make it easier for employers to fill vacancies where there is a shortage of workers in the UK. The government says it wants to stop immigration undercutting British workers and is planning to scrap the 20% discount. Healthcare surcharge to riseThe annual fee visa holders must pay to use the NHS - known as the immigration health surcharge - will rise from £624 to £1,035.There are some exemptions, for example health and care workers do not have to pay the charge, and there is a reduced rate for students and under-18s. Students: review of graduate visaA graduate visa allows someone to stay in the country for at least two years after successfully completing a course in the UK. The government has launched a review of this visa route to prevent what it's called ""abuse"" of the system.More than 98,000 graduate visas were granted in the year to June. The government has already announced plans to limit the number of students who can bring family members with them to the UK. The changes, which come into force in January, remove the right of international students to bring dependents unless they are on postgraduate research courses. Students will also no longer be allowed to switch onto work visas before their studies are completed.

                                Boris Johnson became prime minister in December 2019 and immediately faced the UK's looming exit from the EU and the start of the coronavirus pandemic.The health crisis has been described as perhaps the biggest challenge the country has faced since World War Two.Mr Johnson’s election win secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987.He succeeded Theresa May as prime minister. His only previous cabinet post was foreign secretary, which he quit over differences with Mrs May over Brexit.Since being at 10 Downing Street, he married his fiancee Carrie Symonds and the couple have had two children.

"5 January 2023","What does Rishi Sunak's promise to stop the boats mean?","What does Rishi Sunak's promise to stop the boats mean?5 January 2023ShareDaniel SandfordBBC News home affairs correspondentSharePA MediaIn his first major speech of 2023, prime minister Rishi Sunak twice pledged to ""stop the boats"".Listing five key promises at the beginning and the end of the speech, he said both times: ""We will halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and stop the boats.""That was ""stop the boats"", without qualification.Given that many people in government have recently highlighted what an intractable problem the issue of people crossing the English Channel in small boats is, that seems a rash promise. Forty-four migrants reach UK in first 2023 crossingHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?Elsewhere in the speech, the prime minister did qualify his fifth promise, saying: ""We will pass new laws to stop small boats, making sure that if you come to this country illegally, you are detained and swiftly removed.""But that is a very different pledge. It is easy to pass new laws if you have a majority in Parliament, but much harder to pass laws that will work. It is even harder to enact legislation that will actually stop people smugglers putting desperate people in small boats when it is such a profitable trade. Just look at drugs legislation and how unsuccessful that has been in preventing smuggling.Bogged down When she was home secretary, Priti Patel passed a law that would enact her policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing. However, that policy is still bogged down in the courts, and so far no-one has been sent to Rwanda under the scheme.Also in Ms Patel's Nationality and Borders Act 2022 was a new offence of arriving in the UK illegally, but it has barely been used.Last year, a record 45,756 people entered the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats.The issue came to a head in November when the Manston migrant processing centre near Dover became overwhelmed because of the huge numbers who crossed in October, and a lack of hotel rooms for them. Some migrants spent weeks sleeping on the floor and diseases like scabies and diphtheria started to spread.Other European countries, particularly Germany and France, cope with larger numbers of asylum seekers, but these are much less visible than the shivering migrants being brought ashore in Dover.So what exactly is the prime minister promising - to ""stop the boats"" or to ""pass new laws to stop small boats""?He was asked about this afterwards and admitted: ""This is not an easy problem to fix and it's not one we can fix overnight, and requires lots of different things to be changed.""The most important thing we need to do is pass new legislation, and we want to make sure that new legislation means that if you come here illegally to our country you will not be able to stay. You will be detained and swiftly removed back to a safe country or your own home if that is appropriate,"" he said. ""I just want to make sure that we fix this problem and, having had this job for a few weeks and spent time thinking about it, my belief is that we do need new laws if we want actually to deal with this challenge.""Mr Sunak claimed other initiatives were already making progress: ""The new deal with France means that there's 40% more patrols happening in France, which is making a difference to us.""The new deal with Albania will enable us to return more migrants who have come here from that country back to where they're from. They account for a third of all small boat crossings in the latter part of last year and that can make a really big difference.""Reading the small printOn 13 December, in the House of Commons, Mr Sunak previously promised to reduce the backlog of unprocessed asylum claims and to stop the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers as part of another five-point plan, that time specifically targeted at the small boats crisis.The government expects to spend £2.3bn on hotels for asylum seekers this financial year (2022-23).So this is a case of reading the small print. What Mr Sunak actually promised on Wednesday is to pass new laws to detain and remove people entering the UK illegally. That is not the same as ""stopping the boats"". What is more, this new legislation may well get bogged down in the courts as a potential breach of the UK's refugee obligations, and if it is going to work it will have to be better than the laws passed only last year.

"27 July 2023","Humza Yousaf reveals Scots citizenship and passport plan","Humza Yousaf reveals Scots citizenship and passport plan27 July 2023ShareSharePA MediaMr Yousaf has launched the fifth prospectus in the Building a New Scotland seriesFirst Minister Humza Yousaf has unveiled plans for citizenship and passports in an independent Scotland. A new Scottish government paper sets out proposals on migrants' rights and freedom of movement in the event that the country leaves the union.The prospectus is the fifth in the Building a New Scotland series, which was launched by former first minister Nicola Sturgeon last year.Opposition MSPs have labelled the plans a waste of taxpayers' money. Yousaf unveils 'rights of citizens' constitution planMove to Scottish pound when 'time right' - SturgeonSturgeon unveils case for Scottish independenceSpeaking at launch event in Edinburgh attended by ""New Scots"" including Ukrainian and Syrian refugees, Mr Yousaf said a move to a more ""inclusive"" Irish-style citizenship system would be beneficial morally and economically.He told BBC Scotland it would address ""barriers"" facing those seeking citizenship and help to halt a decline in Scotland's working-age population.  The new paper, called Citizenship in an independent Scotland, proposes that Scotland would allow those born outside the country after independence to be automatically entitled to Scottish citizenship, if at least one of their parents is a Scottish citizen. At a glance: Who would be a Scottish citizen?It also outlines the rights of British citizens to claim dual nationality at the point of independence and set out proposals to make it easier for those from overseas to apply for Scottish citizenship.The paper proposes that Scotland would remain part of the Common Travel Area after independence, allowing British and Irish citizens to live and work in Scotland without restrictions, while Scottish citizens would retain those same rights in the UK and in Ireland.PA MediaThe new prospectus was launched at a roundtable event in EdinburghThe government claims that the Common Travel Area arrangements would mean there would be no new passport or immigration checks at any of Scotland's land, sea or air borders with the UK.The first minister dismissed concerns about such an arrangement, pointing to EU member Ireland's current relationship with the UK under the Common Travel Area. He added: ""If Scotland has a really open, inclusive model of citizenship that allows people to come here to work, to be part of society, to contribute, why on earth would they want to move away from Scotland?"" Mr Yousaf insisted the Scottish government had spent a ""fraction"" of the £3 billion he said it spends every year on ""mitigating the effects of Westminster austerity and the cost of living crisis"". ""These papers are important because we were elected, of course, with a mandate for a referendum and to make that positive case for independence,"" the SNP leader said.Scottish passport According to the proposals, Scottish citizens would have the right to a Scottish passport, which they should be able to apply for and receive by the first day of independence.The paper says that any valid UK passports would continue to be recognised in Scotland until their expiry date, stating it would not be a requirement of Scottish citizenship to hold a Scottish passport. The passports, which would be a burgundy red colour, would follow EU standards for international travel documents and would be available in lengths of five years for children and ten years for adults, it is proposed. The government reiterated its ambition for Scotland to rejoin the EU and set out how it proposes to safeguard the rights of EU citizens.The document says their rights would be upheld in line with the protections of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement ""until such time as they can exercise their reciprocal EU treaty rights to free movement in Scotland once again"". PA MediaMr Yousaf launched the new paper alongside Independence Minister Jamie Hepburn and Circular Economy Minister Lorna SlaterPrevious Building a New Scotland papers have discussed plans to set up a formal constitution and argued comparable independent countries to Scotland are ""wealthier and fairer than the UK"".Other papers laid out economic proposals and said democracy can be ""renewed"" with independence.In response to the latest prospectus launch, Scottish Labour constitution spokesperson Neil Bibby said the Scottish government was ""distracted by its constitutional obsession"".Scottish Conservatives constitution spokesperson Donald Cameron said the publication was a ""blatant misuse of public money and resources by the SNP"".Scottish Liberal Democrat communities spokesperson Willie Rennie also criticised the use of government time and money for something that ""just isn't going to happen"".The paper was launched amid a dispute over Scottish government ministers using civil service staff to develop policy in reserved areas. Cabinet Office minister Lucy Neville-Rolfe told the Lords this week that ""sanctions"" for Scottish ministers would be considered as part of a review of the Cabinet Manual, which codifies the conduct and operation of government and civil servants.Labour peer George Foulkes suggested Scottish ministers could face financial penalties and told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland the UK ""was never meant to be a union of equal partners"".But Robert Hazell, a professor of government and the constitution at University College London who was involved in compiling the Cabinet Manual, told BBC Scotland it was ""perfectly proper"" for civil servants to work on the Scottish government's agenda.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard told BBC Scotland: ""No unelected Lord or UK minister will dictate how our democratic institution operates.""Your passport is a key to your identity.It's the one document that really links you to the state you belong to - or don't want to belong to. My passport is a few years old and a bit worn.There are three key trigger phrases for anyone who follows the Scottish constitutional debate: ""United Kingdom"", ""European Union"" and ""Her Britannic Majesty"" - the current state, Brexit and the future of the monarchy. The Scottish government event was all about citizenship - the people who hold the passport of an independent Scotland.The aim is to follow the Irish model - those born outwith the country after independence will be entitled to Scottish citizenship, if one of their parents is a citizen here.That's the same as the 2013 independence white paper almost ten years ago - it said the birth must be registered in Scotland to take effect.There's nothing surprising here - but there is a real emphasis that this is necessary for a stronger economy with more people working for good public services.  The policy is welcoming of ""New Scots"".  Tie that in with a critique of Westminster migration policies and a strong dose of pro-EU rhetoric, it's a frequent flyer for anyone covering this beat.Questioned if a ""watered-down"" Scottish citizenship would lead to back door migration to the rest of the UK - the first minister turned the argument on its head, saying if there's an open and inclusive model why would they want to move away from Scotland?These papers are often launched on sluggish news days when parliament is on holiday - guaranteeing a good bit of news coverage.It feeds into the critique from the opposition that the Scottish government shouldn't be ""wasting"" money on this - particularly after the Supreme Court ruling last autumn that said aspects of the constitution are reserved. The Conservatives believe a line should now be drawn but the SNP resist, portraying that as a further squeeze on Scottish democratic institutions. What are more problematic for the first minister is perhaps, his own internal critics in the nationalist movement.They could hit out at the drawing up of shiny burgundy passport plans - but may feel the journey to a successful strategy to gain a fresh independence referendum has not yet been properly embarked upon.

"13 April 2022","Partygate fines: Are Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak finished?","Partygate fines: Are Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak finished?13 April 2022ShareChris MasonPolitical correspondent, BBC NewsSharePA MediaRishi Sunak and Boris Johnson on a visit to a brewery last yearBoris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have been fined by the Metropolitan Police over lockdown parties in Downing Street. Can lawmakers get away with being lawbreakers? Not just any law maker, but the prime minister and the chancellor. And not just any law, but the one that confined millions of us to our homes, closed schools, crippled businesses and were designed to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths.The law which the prime minister himself said, while looking solemnly at us down a camera, was essential to our safety and which we must all obey.The PM faced the cameras again on Tuesday to apologise for breaking those laws, while insisting it did not occur to him at the time that he was doing anything wrong.LIVE: Reaction as PM and Sunak fines revealedJohnson and Sunak to be fined over lockdown partiesThe Covid rules when Downing Street parties were held ""But, of course,"" he added, ""the police have found otherwise and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation."" He tried to sound contrite, saying people had a right to expect better from their prime minister.But he made it clear he will not be resigning, telling reporters he intended to ""get on with the job"".Will this be enough to save his skin? When Partygate dominated the headlines, many observers believed it was only a matter of time before Tory MPs triggered a no confidence vote in him.But that sense of momentum has evaporated to some extent.Firstly, and potentially importantly, there aren't many MPs around. It is the Easter break. The chance to plot, to gossip, to fume, to agitate isn't there.Sure there are WhatsApp groups, but they are not quite the same.But secondly, and more importantly, the context has changed.MomentumWar has broken out in Europe; our television screens are dominated by the horrific images we see every day from Ukraine.Who did or didn't drink a glass of wine, where and with whom months and months ago in lockdowns so many of us are desperate to put behind us can, to some, seem trivial, parochial in that context.In recent weeks, some Conservative MPs have made it known they had withdrawn their letters saying they had no faith in Boris Johnson's leadership.That momentum I was talking about felt like it was draining out of the issue.The big question, then - is what happens now?Could Conservative MPs, talking to voters ahead of next month's local elections, encounter a tidal wave of anger from constituents that makes them think again about the prime minister's future?Or have a crucial chunk of voters moved on too?What will be the verdict of voters next month, and to what extent would that be able to be pinned on Partygate anyway?UnorthodoxPolitics is at its keenest and its most compelling when the biggest questions are uncertain; where, whatever the speculation - and there'll be plenty - the next public actions and decisions of Westminster's biggest players aren't obvious.Make no mistake: this is uncharted territory. For the very first time, it is publicly known that the prime minister and the chancellor broke the very laws they put in place, in the very place where they were devised.Even if Conservative MPs don't have the appetite to remove Boris Johnson now, even if the electorate's verdict next month isn't clear, this is a line from the prime ministerial CV he will never shift.A prime minister who's built a career on being unorthodox and has survived the apparently politically unsurvivable before, finds the dice rolling again.As a pollster put it to me the other day, political events can be classified as turning points or talking points.The vast majority are the latter, noisy, but of little long-term consequence.This could still have the potential to be the former, even if nothing changes immediately.Coronavirus lockdown measuresBoris JohnsonRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61079172"
"14 July 2018","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament14 July 2018ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentSharePADoes the Government have a Commons majority anymore? Next week we will see the first post-Chequers test of whether disgruntled Brexiteer Tories, deeply unhappy with what they see as the PM's soft-boiled version of leaving the EU, will still toe the party line.For the last few months the Conservative whips have been seeking to fend off a threat on their Remain flank, posed by a group of up to 20 backbencher arguing for the softest possible Brexit; suddenly the threat comes from 60 to 80 Brexiteers. And unlike the Remainers, who have the air of refugee aristocrats, struggling to master the insurgent arts, they are mostly habitual rebels, case hardened by the battles of the Major and Cameron years. In short, the threat confronting the Chief Whip, Julian Smith, is suddenly orders of magnitude greater - and that was before President Trump added his few dimes' worth to the debate.One of the big determinants of Mr Smith's problems will be the conversations his flock will be having with their Conservative constituency associations over the weekend which will dictate the tone of the coming week; will MPs detect a yearning for unity from their troops, or a burning sense of Brexit betrayal? If the latter, all kinds of mayhem will follow - enough letters could be submitted to the Chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, to trigger a confidence vote in Theresa May. There might be more resignations, and a serious warning shot or two at the government in the votes due on the Customs and Trade bills, which are due for report stage consideration on Monday and Tuesday. Theresa May herself will have PMQs, and an appearance before the Liaison Committee, which will give her Tory critics a chance to vent at her. And she might also find herself fielding urgent questions in the backwash of the Trump visit and the NATO summit. The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after BrexitWhat's the EU common rulebook?What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Then there's Boris. Will the former Foreign Secretary, emboldened by presidential praise, seek to take his case to the Commons? I have no information one way or another, but next week provides a wealth of opportunities. He could speak in the debates on the Trade or Customs bills, or in Wednesday's general EU debate. Or he could opt for a full-dress resignation statement in the manner of Geoffrey Howe. Angry ex-colleagues can inflict near mortal wounds on Prime Ministers - Geoffrey Howe's evisceration of Margaret Thatcher in 1990 remains the classic example, although based on the opposite view of the EU. Or there was Norman Lamont's devastating attack on John Major - ""in office but not in power"". But for maximum effect, the resignee needs a packed House and the presence of his target, so the cameras can cut to her expression as each barb hits home - so a resignation statement after PMQs, giving the Prime Minister little opportunity to escape, and no opportunity to reply, looks to be the way to inflict maximum damage. Again, I emphasise, this is pure speculation in the absence of actual data - but hey.Monday 16 JulyThe Commons opens (2.30pm) with Home Office Questions - and any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions (a reportback on the Nato summit, perhaps) to follow at 3.30pm. Then comes the first of the week's two big Brexit bills, the Taxation (Cross-Border Trade) Bill - the report stage of this measure has been postponed for quite a while, for fear of a Tory Remainer ambush, but now, there's a new threat in the shape of four new amendments from Brexiteers: there are some pointed Brexiteer amendments - and even some chuntering that some Tory MPs might oppose the bill at third reading, to register a protest at the government's Brexit policy. Tory rebels target May's Brexit planPlan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for'Brexiteer and former Cabinet minister Priti Patel has new clause 36 which requires that HMRC won't collect other countries' tariffs unless there is a reciprocal arrangement; Bernard Jenkin's amendment 72 says the government will not be able to use powers to implement a customs union without a separate piece of legislation; Craig Mackinley's amendment 73 says the government will have to commit to having a separate VAT system to the EU, and Lawrence Robertson wants to rule out a customs border in the Irish Sea.Brexiteers are toying with a ""proof of life"" amendment to remove ministers powers to enact ""a"" customs union with the EU, on the argument that this is an option ruled out by the Chequers deal. In Westminster Hall there's a Petitions Committee debate on e-petition 222419: ""Reject calls to add Staffordshire Bull Terriers to the Dangerous Dogs Act.""In the Lords from 2.30 pm, there's a question on permitting the use of cannabis oil on prescription from the Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard.The main legislating is the second reading of the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill. Here, the key issue concerns the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards for people lacking mental capacity, who are detained for treatment in care homes or hospitals. The final business of the day is a short debate on maximising the income from the National Lottery and its use for the arts and good causes.The Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions. Will BEIS Secretary Greg Clark, seen as a key cabinet voice arguing for the softest possible Brexit, be targeted by hard Brexiteers on his own side?Then comes an intriguing Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Giles Watling, who wants to regulate anti-loitering devices which emit a loud and painful sound that can only be heard by certain age groups, including children and teenagers. This sound is annoying to the point where people cannot stay in the area. But he believes they are not the right answer to anti-social behaviour, and only drive the problem elsewhere. So he proposes introducing a licence, regulated by a local authority. The day's main event will be the report and third reading stages of the Trade Bill - a Brexit measure designed to establish a framework for UK international trade, outside the EU institutions which have regulated it since 1972. Recent events may have taken the heat out of the ""Soubry"" amendment to keep the UK in ""a"" customs union with the EU.  There are several amendments along these lines from various different sources - but normally it's the rebel Conservative amendments which are most dangerous to the government. And the government has put down a raft of changes to meet concerns about excessive ministerial power.PAIn Westminster Hall debates include government policy on visas for non-EEA workers on inshore fishing vessels (9.30am) led by the Scottish Conservative, Douglas Ross. He warns a shortage of labour is reaching critical levels with some boats being sold and others tied up as crew are simply unavailable. He wants the government to reinstate a previous system allowing non-EEA residents to work on fishing boats.Labour MP Kate Green leads a debate on homelessness among refugees (2.30pm) and the Conservative Mark Pritchard has a debate (4.30pm) on Nordstream 2 - the new export gas pipeline running from Russia to Europe across the Baltic Sea.My committee pick is the Education hearing (9.30am) with Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Anne Milton, who will be questioned by her immediate predecessor the committee chair, Robert Halfon.Not on the committee corridor, the Treasury Committee has a hearing (9am) on the Bank of England's Financial Stability Report (published twice a year looking at the state of the financial system), where the chief witnesses is the Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, and Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive, Andrew Bailey. Unusually, possibly uniquely, this will be held at Farnborough Air Show, because the committee accepted an invitation to attend and meet business leaders.In the Lords (2.30pm), question time includes a call for an inquiry into the implementation of the new railway timetables - from Lord Bradshaw. The day's legislating will see peers rattle through a series of bills, starting with the second reading of the Ivory Bill, where there will be pressure for the extension restrictions on trading to other ivory-bearing animals and to tighten up on cybercrime sales of ivory.The Commons opens with Wales questions (11.30am) before the last PMQs before the summer break, at noon.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Madeleine Moon, is on the definition of terminal illness for social security purposes, and then MPs move to consideration of Lords amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill.ReutersWill MPs remove a Lords amendment to require the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to develop a relative price cap for suppliers? This would fix the difference between the cheapest rates charged and the most expensive. It is an amendment Labour had previously pushed in the Commons and lost - so expect it to be struck down and the bill returned to the Lords at the end of the day. The main debate is a general debate (ie on a ""neutral motion"") on the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union - essentially it is a chance to discuss the Chequers deal on future customs arrangements and the white paper which embodies it. Which means that ministers could be in for a rough ride. But it will also be worth watching for any possible evolutions in Labour's position - and for any manoeuvres by the small but possibly significant band of Labour Brexiteers. In Westminster Hall debates include: Russia and the Council of Europe (9.30am); progress on protecting victims of domestic abuse in the family courts (2.30pm); the government's 2017 litter strategy and roadside litter (4pm) and NHS whistleblowers and the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (4.30pm).My committee pick is the Liaison Committee hearing with Theresa May (3pm) - where the subjects will be Brexit (inevitably); air quality (the subject of a major joint report by an alliance of select committees); defence spending, where the Defence Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have deep concerns about overstretch in the defence budget; and the ever-controversial multi-billion pound programme for Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster. In the Lords (3pm) peers polish off the third reading of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill, followed by the Northern Ireland Budget (Money) Bill. There is a 90-minute mini-debate on plans to address obesity, followed by ping-pong on Commons amendments to the Domestic Gas and Electricity (Tariff Cap) Bill - where the main interest centres around the relative price cap amendment added to the bill by peers a couple of weeks ago - which may well have been struck down by MPs. HoCThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Exiting the European Union questions - the new secretary of state, Dominic Raab, has already had a bit of a baptism of fire, after the furious complaints about his failure to provide copies of the Brexit White Paper, when he launched it in the Commons. Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, follows with the weekly Business Statement, which will lay out what MPs will discuss in their first week back, in September, after the Summer recess. Then the Leader will remain at the dispatch box to move a motion to set up the Commons new Independent Complaints and Grievance Policy.  This may not be a simple occasion. Different groups around the Commons have all kinds of concerns about this proposal. Some say it does not go far enough, in that the Commons Standards Committee, dominated by MPs, will remain the ultimate arbiter of complaints. Some fear that the system will touch off a new tsunami of scandals, despite the considerable protection built in for MPs, including anonymity while complaints are investigated. There are concerns that the system of handling complaints could lead to very serious offences being handled in-house, with outright rape being treated as ""sexual misconduct"".That could lead to accusations of cover-up and offenders being eased out, only for Parliament to be accused of cover-up. Others worry that an internal process could lead to MPs, in particular, being convicted and ruined on a ""balance of probability"" standard of proof, which could mean serious injustice. This is unwhipped business at a time when many MPs may be absent, or on early holiday - so the policy will probably be approved. Finally, there will be a general debate on the Tobacco Control Plan.In Westminster Hall (1.30pm) there's a backbench debate on perinatal mental illness, led by Labour's Dr Paul Williams, a GP and the Conservative, Andrew Selous. They say more than half of women suffer a mental health or emotional problem around pregnancy, which can impact on the developing child as well as the mother, and they want to make sure that the routine health checks around pregnancy, particularly the six week check after birth, should include a check on the mother's emotional and mental well-being.  Unusually for a Thursday, there are a couple of committees in action: Environmental Audit (10.15am) quiz foreign office minister Sir Alan Duncan and Environment Minister Thérèse Coffey on the Changing Arctic, while Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs (10.30am) quiz Britain's top civil servant, the acting Cabinet Secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, on his work. In the Lords (11am) the day is devoted to backbench debates. First is on the value to the UK of higher education as an export; and the second on the impact on parliamentary democracy in the UK of the use of referendums. Then come two energy SI approval motions: on the Warm Home discount; and on the Oil and Gas Authority.The Commons is not sitting, but the Lords meets at 10am to debate three private members' bills First is the Conservative Lord Lexden's Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) (Sibling Couples) Bill which allows siblings aged over 30 years, to register as civil partners if they have lived together for a continuous period of 12 years immediately prior to the date of registration. Then comes the Children Act 1989 (Amendment) (Female Genital Mutilation) Bill which would take court cases on FGM into family court cases, giving them extra confidentiality. This bill comes from the Crossbencher, Lord Berkeley of Knighton.Finally there's the European Union (Information, etc.) Bill - from the Lib Dem (and ex Conservative) Lord Dykes. This would allow information and statistics about the European Union to be made available and promote town twinning arrangements.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-44832598"
"16 April 2022","Patel personally approved Rwanda plan launch after civil servant concerns","Patel personally approved Rwanda plan launch after civil servant concerns16 April 2022ShareShareEPAPriti Patel had to personally approve a scheme to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda after her officials voiced concern over value for money.The home secretary issued a rare ""ministerial direction"" to push through the plans, meaning she takes responsibility for it.It is only the second time the Home Office has used the power in 30 years.A union for top civil servants said the plan was ""divisive"" but officials would have to implement it or leave.FDA general secretary Dave Penman told BBC News: ""Civil servants know their job is to support the government of the day. They sign up for that knowing they might not like what the government does.""On the more divisive policies, which this clearly is, they face a choice - implement or leave. That could mean elsewhere in the Home Office, another department, or the service.""Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union, which also represents civil servants, said: ""For the government to attempt to claim this is anything other than utterly inhumane is sheer hypocrisy.""We have already seen that they are prepared to risk lives by turning boats back in the channel - a policy which we have had to take them to court over. It is a heartless approach that displays total disregard for human life which everyone must oppose.''The use of a ministerial direction highlights the unconventional nature of the government's refugee relocation plan. As well as criticism of the policy on legal, moral and logistical grounds there is concern from officials at the Home Office about the cost. The department couldn't say whether the scheme would be value for money, which is perhaps not surprising given ministers have openly admitted they don't know how much money will need to be spent. Flying asylum seekers to another country is not a world first but it's a new and controversial approach for the UK. The policy is testing the reach of the government's powers. Home Office civil servants could not precisely quantify the benefits of the policy, and uncertainty about the costs meant Ms Patel had to take personal responsibility for it by issuing the ministerial direction.A source close to the home secretary said ""deterring illegal entry would create significant savings"" and the fact that the savings could not be quantified precisely should not prevent action from being taken.Ministerial directions have been used 46 times since the 2010 election, with two in the Home Office since 1990, according to the Institute for Government think tank.The other time the formal order was used by the Home Office was in 2019 by former home secretary Sajid Javid, to bring in the Windrush Compensation Scheme before legislation was in place.Under the £120m scheme, people deemed to have entered the UK unlawfully since 1 January could be flown to Rwanda, where they will be allowed to apply for the right to settle in the east African country.The government said flights could begin within weeks, initially focusing on single men who crossed the Channel in small boats or lorries.More than 6,000 people have crossed in small boats so far this year. The latest Home Office figures suggest last year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,466 in 2020.Is Rwanda a land of safety or fear?Analysis: Rwanda deal does what no country has done beforeWhich other countries send asylum seekers overseas?More than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged ministers to scrap the policy - which has also drawn criticism from opposition parties and some Conservatives.Sir David Normington, a former head civil servant in the Home Office, told BBC Newsnight the policy was inhumane and morally reprehensible, adding it was ""probably unlawful and it may well be unworkable"".Labour's shadow justice minister Ellie Reeves called it ""unethical and unworkable"" and said it would fail to deter people from crossing the Channel. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the scheme would be a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" and claimed it had been announced as part of a ""cynical distraction"" from the Partygate scandal surrounding No 10.Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, said it was ""absolutely chilling"".Gillian Triggs, an assistant secretary-general at the UNHCR, said such a policy - which is similarly used in Australia - could be effective as a deterrent but there were ""much more legally effective ways of achieving the same outcome"".Australia has used offshore detention centres since 2001, with thousands of asylum seekers being transferred out of the country since then.It has been frequently criticised by the UN and rights groups over substandard conditions at its centres and its own projections show it will spend $811.8m (£460m) on offshore processing in 2021-22.Last year, the UK government raised concerns at the UN about claims of ""extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture"" in Rwanda, as well as restrictions to civil and political rights. But a Home Office spokeswoman said Rwanda was a ""safe and secure country with a track record of supporting asylum seekers"" and that under the plans, the country would ""process claims in accordance with the UN Refugee convention, national and international laws"".Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain on Friday justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove argued that while the short-term costs would be ""pretty equivalent"" to what the UK was paying currently to accommodate those claiming asylum, the new scheme would save British taxpayers money in the ""longer term"".The scheme comes as part of broader efforts to cut the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats - with the Royal Navy taking operational command of patrolling the Channel from UK Border Force.A BRIEF HISTORY OF CHOCOLATE: The origins of one of our favourite sweet treatsBEHIND THE PROMISES AND CLAIMS: Could switching to an electric car save you money?First asylum seekers could be in Rwanda 'in weeks'UK criticised over 'cruel' Rwanda asylum planOne-way ticket to Rwanda for some UK asylum seekersLand of safety - or fear?

The three party leaders said they have ""put differences aside"" to deliver shared policy objectives as the Oxfordshire Fair Deal Alliance. Liz Leffman, leader of the Lib Dem group, was appointed the new leader of the council earlier.Ms Leffman, councillor for Charlbury and Wychwood, was elected as her party's leader on Saturday after former leader Richard Webber stepped down.

"25 February 2019","Brexit: MPs to have vote by 12 March, says May","Brexit: MPs to have vote by 12 March, says May25 February 2019ShareShare1:10May: Brexit deal ""within grasp"" for 29 MarchMPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.Speaking as she travelled to an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt, Mrs May ruled out holding another so-called ""meaningful vote"" this week.But she said ""positive"" talks with the EU were ""still ongoing"" and leaving on 29 March was ""within our grasp"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of ""recklessly running down the clock"".In a tweet, he said the move was intended to ""force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"".Labour, he said, would ""work with MPs across the Commons to prevent no deal, break the deadlock and build support for our alternative plan"".Brexit must not be frustrated, May vowsCabinet trio issue Brexit delay warningBrexit: A really simple guideA lonely PM nears the Brexit endgameOn the plane to Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit between EU and Arab league leaders, Mrs May said her team would be returning to the Belgian capital on Tuesday for further talks. ""As a result of that, we won't bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,"" she added. Mrs May has already met European Council President Donald Tusk for talks after landing in Egypt and will meet other EU leaders on the fringes of the summit later.She said negotiations were continuing over the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - after Parliament voted for her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to what is set out in her deal. What does 12 March Brexit vote date tell us?It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight.The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit.It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission.But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline.Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"".In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done.Read Laura's blogMrs May also rejected an accusation - made last week by MP Anna Soubry as she quit the Conservative Party - that she had a ""personal problem"" with immigration. ""I have consistently said that immigration has been good for this country,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""It's important that we have welcomed people coming to the country over the years - both people migrating to the UK for work purposes but also crucially those many refugees and asylum seekers.""1:39Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was 'worried' the prime minister had a problem with immigration.And she also made clear that she wants to stay on in Number 10 after the first phase of Brexit finishes, despite having promised her MPs she would not fight the next election.She said her job ""is not just about delivering Brexit"" and ""there is still a domestic agenda that I want to get on with.""'Unbelievable'Yvette Cooper called the latest delay ""utterly shambolic"", tweeting: ""Each time we get closer to cliff edge. How are businesses, public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?"" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, also called the delay ""unacceptable"".And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said it was ""unbelievable"" to leave the vote so close to the planned exit date.

Top of the list is the Cooper-Letwin amendment - and cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke wrote in the Daily Mail that they would be forced to back it if the pro-Leave European Research Group (ERG) - made up of Tory backbenchers - stood in the way of the withdrawal deal being agreed ""in the next few days"".The ERG would then have ""no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit,"" the trio said.Environment Secretary Michael Gove has urged his cabinet colleagues against backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, calling for ""unity"" behind the PM.  0:48Gove: “I will do everything I can to persuade colleagues to stay in government.”Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. While it's likely to be rejected, the moment could still be significant. The party's conference last September bound the leadership to explore all remaining alternatives to the PM's Brexit plan, including a public vote, if it wasn't able to force a general election. Efforts to get an election have failed, so if Labour's own Brexit plan is defeated in the Commons, the only remaining option would be a new referendum.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""we are heading in that direction"", but ""there is still more play in the days ahead"".Mr Watson said the leadership was also looking at an amendment drawn up by two backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would be tabled whenever the next meaningful vote is held.Under the terms of that amendment, Labour MPs would support the prime minister's Brexit deal in exchange for it then being put to a public vote.'Reassurance'Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned on Sunday that his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part.He accused the UK government of wanting to change the backstop to ""placate a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"", and reiterated that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But he told Sky News they would try to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British Parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"".Speaking from the summit on Sunday, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it ""would be good to postpone Brexit"" if the deal was not agreed by the beginning of March.

""We will have a far clearer picture of who is here, and whether they should be - and we will act when they are not,"" she added. The new electronic permits, she added, would also ""make it easier to identify potential new threats before they reach the border"".The Home Office says official migration figures - which are based on surveys conducted at airports and ports - have tended to underestimate the true figure.Passengers required to get a permit under the new system would include those travelling to the UK for a short stay or transiting - changing planes - in the country.People wishing to work in the UK or stay in the country for a long period of time - for example over six months - would need to obtain a visa, rather than an ETA.2:00Priti Patel: 'Our immigration system is broken and we will fix it'The new scheme is modelled on the US Electronic System for Travel Authorization which has been in place since 2009. A similar system also exists in Canada.The 27 European Union countries are planning to introduce their own version - European Travel Information and Authorisation System - next year.In a policy paper published on Monday, the Home Office said it expects the process of processing ETA applications to be ""largely automated,"" with ""complex or adverse decisions"" taken by officials. The Home Office has not confirmed how much an ETA application will cost. The US scheme costs $14 (around £9), and the Canadian one $7 (around £4).Elsewhere in her speech, Ms Patel repeated her pledge to introduce ""wholescale reform"" to ""broken"" asylum system. She said government plans unveiled in March would ""reduce incentives for people to come here illegally - therefore removing the opportunity for criminal gangs to profit"".The proposals - which include deeming ""inadmissible"" asylum applications from people who arrive in the UK having gone through safe countries - have been condemned by refugee and rights groups.  'Talking tough'Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""The home secretary talks about a broken asylum system but it's the Conservatives who have been in power for 11 years and are responsible for that.He added that the idea of e-borders ""has been around for a number of years,"" whilst the loss of data from police databases in January meant there are ""serious questions about the home secretary delivering this digital system.""Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said the government's existing plan to digitise borders was over-budget, and accused Ms Patel of ""talking tough"" whilst failing to improve the UK's ""broken"" immigrations.

Let's look at some of the key things Rishi Sunak has now promised to MPs - and the challenges he faces. ""We will establish a new, permanent, unified Small Boats Operational Command.""The prime minister says the UK's policing of the Channel has been ""too fragmented, with different people, doing different things, being pulled in different directions"".He now plans a ""Small Boats Operational Command"" to bring together military and civilian teams, co-ordinating intelligence, interception, processing, and enforcement. The new command will use ""all available technology, including drones... and then prosecute more gang-led boat pilots"". All of this, however, is already being done in some shape or form - the UK has a dedicated commander of operations against small boats - so it's not clear yet what is changing.The government wants more prosecutions, but there are unprecedented delays in the courts so it's not clear when and how all these proposed extra cases could be heard. ""These extra resources will free up immigration officers to go back to enforcement which will, in turn, allow us to increase raids on illegal working by 50%.""We've asked the Home Office to clarify over what time this target applies. One element of this strategy is to resume sharing immigration status data with banks, so they can deny people access to accounts. But the Windrush scandal revealed how people who were either British, or had a right to be in the UK, had their lives destroyed because the Home Office thought they were illegal immigrants - or had no record of their true status. They lost bank accounts, jobs and homes. The latest progress report on correcting the mistakes of Windrush warned the Home Office earlier this year this problem has still not been fixed. A Home Office spokesman said a ""range of safeguards"" had been introduced to the bank data-sharing process - including ""an improved customer contact and resolution service for those who feel they may have been incorrectly impacted.""""Over the coming months, thousands of Albanians will be returned home.""It's long been a mystery why the arrival of Albanians is such a problem for the Home Office. Ministers can sign an order that declares a particular country to be safe. Since 2003, Albania has been on that list of safe countries - and that should mean that anyone claiming asylum or protection can be quickly sent back there. The government says Albanian crime gangs have been abusing the process under which people can claim protection as a modern-day slave, and it wants to close loopholes - but the evidence for that claimed abuse is disputed.The prime minister has admitted in Parliament that Germany, which takes in far more asylum seekers than the UK, rejects almost every Albanian applicant. Just supposing the government fast-tracks these cases - something Labour says it has long advocated - removing these people takes resources - and it's not remotely clear the Home Office has them. ""We are moving up to 10,000 people out of expensive hotel accommodation into low-cost sites like disused holiday parks and former student halls.""There are more than 100,000 people in the asylum support system waiting for decisions on their cases. About 37,000 are in hotels because the Home Office ran out of homes to put them in. It ran out of homes as its case backlog grew (see below). This government, like Labour before it in the 2000s, has faced significant local opposition to moving asylum seekers into dedicated centres. A plan for one in North Yorkshire fell apart after both this summer's Tory leadership contenders refused to back it. Is that scheme and others now back on? Each centre will need planning permission - and that may mean more campaigns targeting MPs already worried about their seats. ""Early next year we will introduce new legislation to make unambiguously clear that if you enter the UK illegally you should not be able to remain here.""Mr Sunak says this new law would mean that people could be ""detained and swiftly returned"" to their home country or somewhere else - meaning, in theory, Rwanda or an EU destination. The UN's refugee agency says the government's proposals would deny people access to the legal asylum system because of how they arrived. There is also speculation that the government wants to resurrect the ""Detained Fast Track"" - a Labour government scheme that was suspended in 2015 after critics won a legal battle to prove it was unfair. Supporters of DFT say it was valuable in weeding out unfounded claims quickly. By the way - the Rwanda scheme is still in the courts and there's no deal to send people back to the EU because ministers did not include it in the Brexit agreement. ""We expect to abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year.""I've written extensively on how the backlog has rocketed since 2018. Part of the reason is that Home Office staff are taking longer and longer to deal with cases. Another is that since Brexit there has been a growing number of cases it officially won't deal with, so they remain in limbo. (A post-Brexit rule change declared that people coming from the EU could be blocked from making an asylum claim and sent back to the safe country they had come from - but, as said above, the UK has no returns agreement with the EU). The challenge is basically enormous. In 2004 Labour's PM Tony Blair set a far less ambitious target to complete more cases in a given period than new ones joined the pile. It took the Home Office two years to come close to hitting it. Refugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63965141"
"25 September 2020","The week ahead in Parliament","The week ahead in Parliament25 September 2020ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareEPAThis is a week where the twin big issues of the day, the pandemic and Brexit, hit the intricacies of parliamentary process. MPs have to vote on the renewal of emergency powers in the Coronavirus Act while there's a dive into the detail of the controversial Brexit measure, the UK Internal Market Bill, in the Commons.And fresh from having extensively rewritten the Agriculture Bill, peers are preparing to sink their teeth into the Immigration Bill.First the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation fast-tracked into law in March. Tory MPs in bid to increase scrutiny over Covid rulesUK 'lacking leadership' during coronavirus crisisWhilst the Act does include powers to detain infectious persons and disperse events and gatherings, some of the biggest civil liberties restrictions so far - face mask wearing, requirements to self-isolate, the rule of six, etc - are actually made under the 1984 Public Health Act, so its renewal (or non-renewal) would not directly affect them. The Coronavirus Act contains a wide range of powers on matters like re-registering retired medical staff, managing large numbers of dead bodies and postponing local elections, allowing courts to use live links, and even loosening legal requirements on the General Synod of the Church of England.  Were its renewal to be blocked those powers would be unwound in an orderly manner over the subsequent days but that looks pretty improbable. While there may be concerns about the handling of the pandemic, no-one is keen to deploy the nuclear option of blocking renewal, quite yet. But there will be plenty of concerns aired, assurance demanded and changes suggested. Their Lordships seem determined to carry on savaging government legislation. The Fisheries Bill, the Agriculture Bill and many more have already been amended.With the Immigration Bill and, a little later, the Trade Bill before the House and with the UK Internal Market Bill also heading their way - although there's talk it might be postponed while talks with the EU are under way - there will have to be a great deal of parliamentary ping-pong in the coming weeks, with bills bouncing between the Lords and Commons, as agreement is sought. The recent Agriculture Bill defeats, by margins of 107, 49, 95, 48, 62 and 50 votes, demonstrate that the government is still a long way from being able to enforce its will on the red benches. Meanwhile, rather in the parliamentary background, all kinds of orders and regulations (Statutory Instruments in Westminster jargon) concerning the pandemic and Brexit are being processed - some of them rather important. At the moment the SIs have been getting about 20 minutes discussion apiece, most of which is taken up by a minister reading out a carefully-prepared script from which they are not supposed to deviate, because the words they utter could be used in court to help interpret the regulations under discussion. The ones which will underpin the proposed Kent Lorry Permit, announced earlier this week by Michael Cove, will doubtless be particularly contentious Here's my rundown of the week ahead: Monday 28 SeptemberThe Commons week opens (14:30 BST) with an hour of Home Office Questions, doubtless to be followed by the normal quota of ministerial statements or Urgent Questions following up stories in the Sunday papers. And that's followed by a general debate on Covid-19, a kind of extended appetiser to the motion to continue the emergency powers introduced in March, which will be taken on Wednesday. On the committee corridor, a Delegated Legislation Committee will consider the local lockdown regulations imposed on Blackburn, Darwen, Bradford and Leicester among other places. And the Joint Committee on Human Rights (14:30) takes evidence on the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, which aims to protect military veterans from vexatious prosecutions. Critics say it could allow major human rights violations, including torture and murder, to go unpunished and the Committee will focus on the detail of its provisions, the implications of the presumption against prosecution after five years: the justifications for a presumption against prosecution for service personnel and veterans, and the risk of contravening the UK's international legal obligations and implications for the reputation of the UK Armed Forces and the risk of cases against service personnel being brought before the International Criminal Court. The witnesses include the Reverend Nicholas Mercer, former Command Legal Advisor, UK 1st Armoured Division, during the Iraq War. Some of what is said here may well feed back into later debates on the Bill - watch out for Report Stage Amendments in the name of Committee Chair Harriet Harman, and her colleagues. Elsewhere, Public Accounts (14:30) returns to a saga that it has examined repeatedly over the last decade - the Carrier Strike programme, which has been dogged by delays and cost over-runs. MPs will question senior officials from the Ministry of Defence.In the Lords (13:00) proceedings open with the introduction of two more new peers, Baroness Fullbrook of Dogmersfield - the former Conservative MP for South Ribble, Lorraine Fullbrook - and Lord Sarfraz, who was Treasurer of the Conservative Party during the 2019 general election. At 38, he will become the third youngest peer in the Lords.Questions to ministers range across helping with medical and funeral expenses of those who have had Covid-19, helping regional theatres survive the pandemic, reforming the asylum system and the publication of the next energy White Paper - that last is from Lord Howell of Guildford, Margaret Thatcher's energy secretary, back in the 1980s.The main debate is on a ""take note"" motion on renewing the temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act.While MPs have to vote, every six months, to keep the Act in force, there is no role for the House Lords in the decision. Nevertheless it was thought appropriate for peers to have a debate to air their views and, as I write, there are 52 names on the speakers' list for this debate.Tuesday 29 September MPs begin their day (11:30 BST) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is proposed by the SNP's Tommy Sheppard, who wants problem drug use to be declared a public health emergency. His Bill calls for limited decriminalisation of possession of drugs for personal use and for safe drug consumption facilities to be provided, as well as a variety of other measures.Then MPs will move on to the Remaining Stages of consideration of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill. Two days had originally been scheduled, but that has now been cut to a single day. As well as the usual opposition amendments targeting key sections of the Bill, there are some significant government amendments - including one which softens the ban on legal challenges to government actions under the Bill, so that judicial review would now be permitted. This was one of the key points on which super-lawyers in the Lords had objected to the Bill, so it will be interesting to see if they believe this is enough.Labour has put down new clauses to replace the controversial Northern Ireland clauses with a commitment to adhere to specific clauses in the Withdrawal Agreement, and to create common rules for the internal market which would be subject to regular review.There's a rather rare creature, a joint DUP and Labour clause to require an assessment every year of the impact on businesses and consumers from the Northern Ireland Protocol. It would cover impact of any regulatory trade policy divergence. And the Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh has a new clause which would allow the government to put down a ""unilateral interpretative declaration"" about the trade rules for Northern Ireland, for approval by the Commons, in the event of the EU not acting in accordance with international law in the implementation of the Protocol. The adjournment debate, led by the former Business Secretary Greg Clark, is on flexible rail ticketing.On the committee corridor, there are more pandemic measures under scrutiny - this time the Health Protection Regulations 2020 are before a Delegated Legislation Committee for ninety minutes of consideration.Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs looks at the work of the Cabinet Office (09:30) and Health and Social Care (09:30) has a session on the safety of maternity services.In the Lords (12:00) there are two more new arrivals - the Conservative former Chief Whip Lord McLoughlin and Baroness Hayman of Ullock, who, as Sue Hayman, was Shadow Environment Secretary under Jeremy Corbyn. Question time ranges across protecting victims of child trafficking during the pandemic, funding the Female Offender Strategy and the political situation in Hong Kong.After that, peers rattle through a series of orders and regulations - first the Air QualityRegulations 2020, then the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2020 and finally a motion to take note of the Electric Scooter Trials and Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2020.Wednesday 30 September A busy Commons day, full of interest for procedure nerds, opens at 11:30 BST with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, followed, at Noon by Prime Minister's Question Time.Former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell proposes the day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, to create an accreditation scheme for businesses which meet standards on paying taxes, workers' rights and environmental performance. Then MPs give what will probably be a rather perfunctory Second Reading to the Non-Domestic Rating Bill. This is a pandemic measure to postpone the next revaluation for non-domestic rates in England and Wales by one year, to 1 April 2023, based on rents at a valuation date of 1 April 2021. Before the pandemic, the government had been planning to bring the revaluation forward to 2021. PA MediaIt is not clear whether the Speaker will accept Sir Graham Brady's amendmentNext comes the motion to renew the temporary powers granted in the Coronavirus Act 2020 - which will be a short 90-minute debate because it is a proceeding under an Act under Standing Order No 16. The exact wording is important here: the motion, specified in the Act, is that the temporary powers it grants ""should not yet expire"". So this is framed as a straight Yes or No question, which should not be capable of amendment. There is an amendment proposed by Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady, which calls for the powers to be renewed at a more frequent interval than the current six months. The initial steer is that it is unlikely the Speaker would select such an amendment, because the priority would be to get a ""clean answer""  to the question posed, although Sir Graham's effort is carefully drafted to avoid casting doubt on the outcome of the vote. Another point is that Speakers always look at ""breadth"" of support for an amendment, by which they mean not just the raw numbers, but the level of cross-party appeal.The presence of Labour's Harriet Harman, Chair of the Human Rights Committee, and Labour ex-whip John Spellar on the list of supporters, alongside several select committee chairs, may supply that extra zip. Whichever way that decision goes, the debate looks certain to see some venting by increasingly uncomfortable Conservative MPs - and ministers may have to offer some assurances to meet their concerns. Then the Sentencing Bill will zip through all its Commons stages of consideration, without touching the sides. This is a massive piece of legislation - the biggest of this Parliament - with 420 clauses, printed in two volumes. It is a major tidying-up exercise to sort out the contradictory mass of law around sentencing. In 2012, an analysis of 262 randomly selected cases in the Court of Appeal Criminal Division found that 36% had received unlawful sentences, because of the complexity of existing legislation. And because it is a ""consolidation bill"" prepared by the Law Commission, it goes through Parliament via a special streamlined process. Finally, MPs move on to a Labour motion against a series of Statutory Instruments on planning, which have the effect of giving the owners of blocks of flats the ability to extend without seeking full planning permission. This was first spotted by the Conservative Peter Bottomley, who put down an Early Day Motion against the SIs - and the issue has now been picked up by Labour, who argue that, post-Grenfell, it raises serious safety concerns. On the committee corridor, Women and Equalities (14:40) hold a one-off session on the impact of coronavirus on children. In the Lords (12:00), Question Time covers compensation for cancelled holidays and safety testing standards for lightweight polyethylene chest plates The main legislative action is the first day of report stage consideration on the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination Bill - where peers are cranking up for another substantial rewrite.PAPeers are seeking to make substantial changes to the Immigration BillLabour's Lord Dubs, who famously campaigned to get child migrants admitted to the UK, is proposing two cross-party amendments on safe family reunion routes for child refugees and helping children in care, who are losing their free movement rights to become legally resident.Another big vote will be on ending indefinite immigration detention - limiting detention to 28 days. This comes from the Lib Dem, Lady Hamwee, but is signed by Labour front-bencher Lord Kennedy. Alongside that, the former Chief Inspector of Prisons, Lord Ramsbotham, has an amendment to ban the use of segregation—being detained apart from other immigration detainees, except in specified exceptional circumstances. And Lady Hamwee also has an amendment on the rights of UK citizens who have moved to the EU, to return home with their family over coming years.Labour's Lord Rosser has an amendment on the future of social care which he hopes will attract cross-party support. It requires an independent report on the impact of the new immigration system on the social care workers, and long-term consequences for recruitment, training and pay for our key workers. Lib Dem Lord Oates wants those with settled status given physical proof, perhaps in the form of a biometric ID card The crossbencher Lord Green of Deddington, the former British diplomat who was the founding chairman of Migration Watch UK, has an amendment to cap the number of people admitted to the UK to work each year.And the Conservative Lord Flight, has amendments to ensure that the powers in the Bill can only be used in ways consistent with the UK's obligations under the EU Withdrawal Agreement. I'm not sure how many of these will be dealt with on day one. Thursday 1 OctoberMPs begin (09:30) with questions to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove.  That is followed by the weekly statement on forthcoming Commons business from the Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg.And then MPs move on to the annual Social Security Benefits Uprating Bill  - a slightly more complicated exercise when the normal ""triple lock"" indicators on which the uprating is based, like average wages and inflation, have been somewhat scrambled by the pandemic. On the committee corridor, Welsh Affairs takes evidence on Brexit and trade: implications for Wales, with witnesses from Cardiff Airport, Associated British Ports, Stena Line and the British Ports Association (09:30)Public Accounts (10:00) looks at the asylum accommodation and support transformation programme with top officials from the Home OfficeIn the Lords (12:00) questions cover the use of Do Not Resuscitate notices in hospitals and nursing homes since March, and the new sentencing tariff for those who intend to commission a crime and kill a member of the emergency services.Then, peers turn to the Third Reading of the Agriculture Bill - normally a brief rubber-stamping exercise - before they embark on the Second Reading of the Fire Safety Bill, the post-Grenfell measure to spell out the responsibility for fire safety in multi-occupation dwellings. Neither House is due to sit on Friday 2 October.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54296971"
"12 June 2018","Theresa May tells MPs not to undermine UK's Brexit negotiations","Theresa May tells MPs not to undermine UK's Brexit negotiations12 June 2018ShareShareEPAThe PM wants to avoid defeats ahead of a crucial summit of EU leaders later this monthThe UK's negotiating position will be undermined if MPs defeat the government in key votes on its Brexit bill, Theresa May has told Tory MPs.The prime minister told backbenchers to ""think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union"".She wants to overturn a series of amendments made by the House of Lords.A compromise proposal is being worked on which could help Mrs May avoid defeat on whether the UK should seek to stay in a customs union with the EU.The move, being brokered by former Cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, came after rebel MPs suggested they have sufficient numbers to threaten the government and wanted more concessions.Flashpoints ahead for the Brexit billWhy is the customs union so important?A big week for Brexit2:42What is the EU customs union?There will be two days of votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday and Wednesday.The bill is the key legislation the government needs to pass to make its Brexit strategy work. But the House of Lords has put forward changes to it which would require a different approach in some key areas.This week the government wants to kill off most of these changes - but numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get a majority.The two amendments set to be most tricky for the government are one on Tuesday, which gives Parliament a decisive vote over the final Brexit deal, and another on Wednesday which instructs Mrs May to negotiate a customs union with the EU.Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""minded"" to vote against the government on the first of these, which calls for Parliament to get a ""meaningful vote"" on any final deal struck between the UK and EU.She also called for ""further concessions"" from the government on the customs union amendment.Conservative backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he thought the government would win the day.Speaking on LBC, Mr Rees-Mogg, who chairs the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, predicted ""there will be unity, it won't be perfect"" but that it would be ""enough to get the bill through"".The key dates ahead on Brexit

What is the EU Withdrawal Bill?It is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU.It will repeal the European Communities Act, which took Britain into what was then the European Economic Community, meaning EU law is no longer supreme in the UK.And to avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change.The bill has also become of the focus of several attempts by MPs and peers to change parts of the government's approach to Brexit.The legislation is now back before the House of Commons after a total of 15 defeats by the House of Lords.What MPs will be voting onAFPThe government opposes these amendments:Grant new powers to oversee changes made to EU law by the governmentRemove the precise day of Brexit from the wording of the billRemove a section allowing ministers to use secondary legislation to establish when individuals can challenge the validity of retained EU law after exitOnly let ministers use delegated powers to amend retained EU law where ""necessary"" Prevent ministers from using delegated powers to implement the UK-EU Withdrawal AgreementForce the government to report on ""steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU"" by 31 OctoberMake staying in the European Economic Area, like Norway, a ""negotiating objective"" for the UKTransfer the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights - which the government says will no longer apply - into UK lawAllow ""enhanced scrutiny"" when ministers use delegated powers to change EU employment, equality health and safety, consumer and environment rulesThe government has proposed its own version of these ones:Give Parliament the power to decide what happens if MPs and peers reject the final Brexit dealExplicitly preserve cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic and commit to no new border arrangements without the agreement of the UK and Irish governmentsAllow people to challenge UK law if it fails to comply with the general principles of EU lawForce ministers to maintain EU environmental principles in domestic law after BrexitCompel ministers to aim for a deal allowing unaccompanied child refugees to join relatives in the UKThe government has accepted this amendment:Allow the UK to replicate EU law made after Brexit day and continue to participate in EU agenciesTo rebel or not rebel?At a specially convened meeting in Parliament, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"". ""I am trying to negotiate the best deal for Britain. I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible.""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.""Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington set out the government's plea to potential rebels, saying the House of Lords had tried to damage the Brexit process by changing the EU bill.The purpose of the bill is to ensure ""legal certainty"" around Brexit, and it is ""profoundly in our national interest"" that MPs do not ""allow hostile amendments to frustrate those essential aims"" he said.""This week, I hope that MPs from all parties, including those Labour MPs who want to see their constituents' votes in the referendum acted upon, will give the prime minister their backing,"" he added.His comments follow the claim from two senior Conservatives, Remainer Amber Rudd and Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, that any rebellion will only play into the Labour leader's hands.

"30 March 2023","Migration dilemma leaves Rishi Sunak confronting an expensive mess","Migration dilemma leaves Rishi Sunak confronting an expensive mess30 March 2023ShareChris MasonPolitical editor, BBC NewsShareGetty ImagesThe rows about small boat crossings over the Channel are the ultimate example of a political bind.An international issue, demanding a national response, provoking local anger.The crossings have shot up. The prime minister has promised to stop them.At least part of what we are seeing in the debates over sorting places for migrants to stay is the consequence of a failure to do that.Another element is the colossal backlog of asylum claims that need to be processed. But a significant part of all of this is a generational challenge lots of rich countries will face.Courtesy of globalisation - smartphones, the internet, satellite television - it has never been easier for poor people in low-income countries, or those caught up in wars, natural disasters or, perhaps in future, the consequences of climate change, to be aware of a richer world they might prefer.What they might easily conclude is a rational decision to seek a better life. Which means rich countries, and their governments, have to conclude what a rational response to this is.How can a country be sustainably compassionate, if indeed that is what it chooses to be? And what would that look like, when both of those words would be contested?Rich countries now have to confront what to do about all this, often still in possession of rules and conventions that pre-date the era of the jet aeroplane and mass international travel.And they - we - confront these challenges burdened by the weight and contradictions of the dilemmas they generate.What to do practically, politically, logistically, financially, morally?Right now, the government confronts an expensive mess.Solutions soughtAs my colleagues Daniel Sandford and Callum May reported earlier this month, more than 51,000 asylum seekers are currently being put up in nearly 400 hotels around the UK.It is costing the taxpayer £6m a day. The government is desperate to find a solution.Something cheaper, something more obviously basic (in the hope that that itself acts as a deterrent) and big sites that can house a lot of people.Former military bases have long been top of the wanted list for ministers - land and buildings relatively easily acquired, that can be converted and up and running quickly. Or so they hope.The political strategy here is this sort of thing is always going to annoy some people, but fewer bigger sites will annoy fewer people, while housing plenty of people.The thing is, those they are annoying are getting angry and getting organised.Conservative-controlled Braintree District Council has asked the High Court to block plans for a migrants site on an old RAF base in Essex.And a legal battle looms between the Conservative-led West Lindsey District Council and the government over a similar plan in Lincolnshire.Boats floatedSome senior voices in government were talking up the prospect of ferries and barges also being used to house migrants - leading to some excitable newspaper front pages.Strikingly, while floating accommodation was mentioned by the Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, there isn't yet any detail about the plans.2:07Robert Jenrick's plans to use military bases ""being disposed of"" face criticism from both sides of the Commons.One figure who worked in government under Labour recalled to me a similar desire to use ships, then to accommodate prisoners.Suffice to say they were more than a little sceptical that the idea will ever see the light of day.They recalled one minister back then being packed off to Rotterdam to look at an ailing old boat the Dutch government wanted rid of.But it was concluded it was so decrepit it probably wouldn't make it over the North Sea and the whole plan was quietly dropped.The challenge is finding the boats, finding the places to put them and building the associated infrastructure, such as offices nearby on land, to make the whole thing work.Ministers now do still seem to be pursuing the idea - as BBC South's political editor Peter Henley reports Portland Port in Dorset has been approached by the Home Office to provide space for what is called an ""accommodation facility"".But there are no further details.Critics of the government say a legacy of mismanaging the asylum system means all these problems now stack up. And it is unquestionable the problems are massive.But it is also unquestionable that the next government, of whatever political colour, will inherit much of the same set of problems.And they are the same set of problems so many other similar rich countries confront - and will continue to confront for decades to come.Ex-military bases to be used in migrant housing planHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Rishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65115212"
"16 March 2018","MPs back bill to reunite child refugees with relatives","MPs back bill to reunite child refugees with relatives16 March 2018ShareShareGabriele Francois Casini/Save the ChildrenChanges to asylum rules that would reunite hundreds of child refugees with their families are a step closer after MPs gave their backing to the plans.Proposed legislation which would enable people who arrived in Britain as a child to sponsor applications for close relatives to settle with them passed its first Commons hurdle on Friday.Ministers say it could encourage people to attempt the risky journey to the UK.But the SNP's Angus MacNeil said it was simply was the ""right thing"" to do. The government has not given its backing to Mr MacNeil's private member's bill but it passed its second reading after Labour, Lib Dem and some Tory MPs spoke in favour of it, as well as the SNP.Labour 'to end deportation heartbreak'UK to end Dubs child migrant promiseGovernment sees off child migrant challengeSpeaking after MPs backed the principle of the bill by 129 votes to 42, Mr MacNeil said it was a simple fact that bringing families together helped them flourish and benefited society as a whole. ""It's clear that this issue isn't about party politics, it's about doing the right thing,"" he said. ""It was pretty obvious to all of us that families belong together and that children belong with their parents. I hope that ministers come to the same compassionate conclusion.""'Story to tell'The bill would also reinstate the right to civil legal aid for refugees and extend the age at which parents can sponsor their children to join them in the UK from 18 to 25.Labour said the proposals would ""address anomalies"" in the refugee system and while it would benefit a relatively small number of people, it would have a ""transformational"" effect on their lives.Speaking in Friday's debate, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the changes would bring ""immigration rules into line with real life"" - and that ""compassion and common sense should take the place of pedantry"". Offering her support, Conservative MP Anna Soubry said refugees were human beings ""each with a story to tell"" of being a victim of war, persecution or natural disaster.By backing the ""modest"" measure, she said it would show the ""type of Conservatives we are all proud to call ourselves"".But her colleague, Will Quince, said he was yet to be convinced that widening the eligibility resettlement criteria was the right thing to do, noting it would do nothing to address the reasons why families had been displaced or address the sources of conflict.He said it was unhelpful for opponents of the bill to be portrayed as ""cold-hearted"" or lacking in empathy. 'Glimmer of hope'Campaigners said Friday's vote offered a ""glimmer of hope"" to the families of refugees separated by conflict.""At the moment, the government's restrictive rules leave refugees isolated, traumatised and alone in the UK, knowing that the people they love still face untold dangers in other countries,"" said Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council. The government's decision to close the Dubs resettlement scheme for child refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries was heavily criticised last year.Campaigners say it should have been used to give sanctuary to 3,000 rather than hundreds of child refugees. The government has said it is committed to resettling 20,000 refugees affected by the Syrian conflict and 3,000 vulnerable children and their family members from the Middle East and North Africa region by 2020.It says more than 9,300 individuals have already been resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, almost half of whom are children.The Dubs scheme was named after campaigner and Labour peer Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child refugee before the outbreak of World War Two.It required the UK government to provide assistance to a specified number of unaccompanied child refugees, who arrived in Europe with no family connections.Labour 'to end deportation heartbreak'","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43428805"
"21 March 2022","Local elections: Wales goes to the polls in fraught times","Local elections: Wales goes to the polls in fraught times21 March 2022ShareFelicity EvansPolitical editor, WalesShareGetty ImagesCovid's impact, the war in Ukraine and cost of living pressures are the backdrop to local electionsA year after the Senedd election, Wales returns to the polls on 5 May to vote for those standing to be councillors across all of the country's 22 local authorities.There are big challenges, like the terrible scenes in Ukraine, that will shape political debate during the election campaign. Wales will soon be welcoming refugees fleeing the war and local councils will have a big part to play in helping to provide support and services for the new arrivals. Welsh second homes may face 300% council tax hikesUp to £200m council pensions cash in Russian fundsCash boost sees pay rise for carers and teachersRising cost of living pressures will also be an increasingly important political issue.We are already noticing increased energy and food bills and while the war in Ukraine will have made these things worse, they would have been a big issue anyway because of other pressures in the world economy. While local councils have little direct control over these pressures, they are on the front line of delivering support and help to people struggling to make ends meet.And this is the first big electoral test for the political parties since the 2021 Senedd election.What's at stake for them?Labour seek to regain groundGetty ImagesLabour matched their best ever performance in last year's Senedd election and polling suggests they're in a strong position heading into this campaign.They have the largest number of councillors in Wales and have majority control of seven councils, all in the south - Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Caerphilly, Cardiff, Newport and Torfaen - but they suffered big losses at the last council elections in 2017. They lost more than a hundred councillors and lost majority control of three councils: Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil.  So they're heading into this set of elections hoping to regain some of that lost ground. Tougher Tory taskGetty ImagesFor the Conservatives, who won their highest ever number of Senedd seats last year, this year's campaign is a tougher proposition. Although these are local government elections, national issues do impact on voters' decision making and Boris Johnson had a very difficult start to the year. It remains to be seen if there will be any backlash over those reports of Covid rule breaking parties at Downing Street or whether the war in Ukraine means voters have moved on. There's also a lot riding on the chancellor's imminent spring statement, because of the pressure on household finances. If planned tax rises go ahead in April, will Welsh Conservatives feel the blowback in May?The Welsh Conservatives did well in the 2017 local council elections - they were the biggest gainers. But that success puts the pressure on this time around because it means they've got more to defend.Keep an eye on Monmouthshire, where they won majority control last time and will want to hold on.It's also worth watching the Vale of Glamorgan and Denbighshire, where they became the largest group in 2017. Plaid Senedd deal a factor?Getty ImagesPlaid Cymru had a disappointing performance in the Senedd election. They are the third largest party in the Welsh Parliament and have entered into a co-operation agreement with the Welsh Labour government in Cardiff Bay, which gives them influence on a variety of policy areas without actually having any ministers in government. Will that give them momentum for these elections, or has their voice been diluted by the hybrid nature of the one foot in, one foot out deal with Welsh government? Plaid made modest gains overall in 2017, increasing their majority in Gwynedd and becoming the largest party in Anglesey.  In Cardiff the party is running a pact with the Greens who have yet to make much impact on local government in Wales. Lib Dems look for green shootsGetty ImagesThe Liberal Democrats have been in the political doldrums for a while, though they clung on to a seat in the Senedd last year. Grassroots campaigning used to be a strength for the party, which has struggled to find a distinctive voice in Welsh politics in recent years. Supporters will be looking for any signs of green shoots this time around. Don't forget independentsGetty ImagesIn most elections not being attached to a big political party stacks the odds of success against you. In local council elections a hot local issue or being well known in your area counts for a lot, and low turnout means fine margins can decide the victor. All of which means independent candidates can be very successful.In fact, independents made up the second largest group of successful candidates in 2017 and in some cases they have teamed up to run councils.Up to £200m council pensions cash in Russian fundsWelsh second homes may face 300% council tax hikesWelsh Liberal DemocratsWalesPlaid CymruWelsh LabourWelsh Conservatives","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-60793566"
"25 November 2022","UK net migration hits all-time record at 504,000","UK net migration hits all-time record at 504,00025 November 2022ShareDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentShareBBCUK net migration hit 504,000 in the year to June - the highest figure ever recorded, The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates.The rise is driven by people arriving legally from outside the EU and the resumption of post-pandemic travel. Reception of Afghan and Ukrainian refugees and people from Hong Kong are other factors. The government has promised to cut net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the UK.Today's figures will intensify debates over the role of overseas workers into the UK economy and wider labour market - weeks after Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she wanted to resurrect a repeatedly missed government target to reduce net migration to below 100,000.Who is allowed to work in the UK?Braverman: We have failed to control our bordersWe will need migration to grow economy, says HuntThat aim, set by former prime minister David Cameron and supported by Theresa May, was dropped by Boris Johnson who said he would reduce the level while ensuring businesses had access to the skills they needed. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the record numbers were ""understandable"" given the circumstances in Ukraine, Afghanistan and Hong Kong, and the ""generosity of the British people"".""But the public rightly expect us to control our borders and we remain committed to reducing migration over time,"" she said.Ms Braverman said the current level of migration was putting pressure on accommodation and housing supply, as well as health, education and other public services. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper acknowledged there were some unique factors behind this year's figures, but said there was also ""real evidence of Conservative mismanagement of both the asylum and immigration systems"".She said the Conservatives ""just don't have a grip"" of the skills shortage or small-boat asylum cases, saying: ""We need action on that, and instead we are not seeing it from the Conservatives.""Overall, an estimated 1.1m people migrated to the UK in the year to June. After subtracting those who emigrated, the UK population has risen by 504,000 - the net migration total. That is a record - a jump from a high of more than 330,000 seen in 2016, the year of the Brexit vote. Asylum applications, including those arriving in small boats over the English Channel, reached 73,000 in the year to September - a figure that underlines that those migrants represent a very small proportion of all those who arrive in the country in any given period. The rise in migration has been influenced by people from outside the European Union - including 170,000 people from Ukraine and 76,000 from Hong Kong under a scheme to resettle people who count as British citizens. Some 277,000 people came to study - with the rate of student visas almost doubling on the previous year. 'Unusually high'The ONS said that the lifting of travel restrictions may have triggered a bump in the number of students - and it was too early to say whether the rise was a long-term trend. The figures are also partially experimental as experts refine more sophisticated ways of counting people. Madeleine Sumption, director of Oxford University's politically independent Migration Observatory research unit, said: ""All the forecasts suggested that migration would fall as a result of the post-Brexit immigration scheme, which greatly restricted the options for EU citizens to move to the UK - and indeed, EU net migration remains negative.""But non-EU migration has risen, primarily not because of the policies designed to replace EU free movement. ""The humanitarian routes for Ukraine and Hong Kong and a rebound in international students have played the largest role in boosting immigration levels.""These unusually high levels of net migration result from a unique set of circumstances following the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis.""We cannot assume they represent a 'new normal', and it would be rash to take major policy decisions based only on these numbers.""Asylum 'neglect'Separate figures published by the Home Office reveal that a record 143,000 people are now awaiting an outcome on their asylum claim, thanks to delays to decision-making. Around 41,000 of them have been waiting for between one and three years for a decision, according to separate research.  In one example of delays, new figures show that just 50 of 7,219 Albanians who arrived by small boats have received a decision on their claim for asylum.Enver Solomon, head of the Refugee Council, said the figures underlined the urgent need for action from the government to make the system work. ""These statistics underline yet again the government's neglect and mismanagement of the asylum system due to a failure to invest in creating an orderly, efficient and effective system,"" he said.  ""The number of men, women and children now living in limbo has risen by 20,000 in just three months.""Ministers must set up a dedicated and well-resourced task force to improve the processing of asylum claims, both to reduce the human misery ...  but also the spiralling costs of accommodating those on the waiting list.""Home OfficeSuella BravermanOffice for National StatisticsMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63743259"
"25 March 2023","What's happening in Parliament this week?","What's happening in Parliament this week?25 March 2023ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareReutersNo gentle winding down for MPs as Parliament heads for its Easter break.The government is moving fast to get its Illegal Migration Bill through the Commons, with Monday and Tuesday devoted to detailed debate in the committee stage of its parliamentary journey.This will allow the Lords to get weaving on the bill fairly soon, although there's still a lingering fear that a slow-motion process in the Upper House could cause problems later.Even with the parliamentary year extended to November, a leisurely debate by peers, and an extended bout of ""ping pong"" to deal with what will probably be a considerable number of Lords amendments, could see ministers negotiating against a deadline.There is a prospect that the whole bill could be lost if it it's not passed before Parliament is prorogued, so watch out for a carry-over resolution, which would punt the bill into the next parliamentary session.It is too early to know what recommendations will flow from Boris Johnson's Privileges Committee appearance on his Partygate statements to MPs. They're expecting to take more paper evidence (further live hearings are not planned) and Mr Johnson gets two weeks to comment on whatever they decide.That means nothing is likely to emerge before mid-May at the earliest. There is a slight twist here, in that any motion comes from the Privileges Committee, not the Standards Committee, which is the normal source of disciplinary motions against MPs. Standards motions are now voted on without debate, but, as a matter of privilege, this would be debatable. And were there a debate, I'm pretty sure Mr Johnson could speak in it.There's plenty more action brewing. The election of a new SNP leader next Monday will reverberate through the party's contingent at Westminster. The SNP may have to absorb a new political strategy, testing the once legendary, but now somewhat frayed party discipline on their benches. Also on Monday, a seven-strong selection panel of senior MPs, led by the Speaker, will interview candidates (I'm told there are four hats in the ring) to replace Sir John Benger as the new clerk of the Commons, the House's top official. It might be a while before white smoke emerges.Monday 27 MarchCommons (14:30): Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30.Main debate: This is the first of two days of Committee of the Whole House on the Illegal Migration Bill. Day one covers the meat of the bill, the clauses limiting the ability to suspend deportation under the European Convention of Human Rights and capping the number of entrants to the UK under safe and legal routes.Perhaps the key amendment is Conservative Danny Kruger's, which says that the bill should operate notwithstanding rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. This has attracted quite a bit of backbench support - 27 Conservatives plus independent Rob Roberts, at the time of writing.  On a similar theme watch out for the veteran Sir Bill Cash's proposal to stop judges granting injunctions to stop the deportation of illegal migrants - both of these are signed by Sir John Hayes, who chairs the Common Sense Group of Tory MPs, the hot new(ish) backbench pressure group on the government benches.There are also Conservative amendments to exclude unaccompanied children from the bill, to guarantee there are safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to enter the UK, and to allow refugee family reunion (from former Lord Chancellor Sir Robert Buckland and former Children's Minister Tim Loughton).Labour plan to use the debates to set out an alternative migration policy, with calls for more international co-operation to tackle migration and people smuggling, more staff to process asylum cases, and more resources for the police and Border Force.Amendments are still appearing, as I write. The Lib Dems are seeking to strike out the key chunk of the bill, clauses 21-28, which would remove protections for victims of modern slavery; and Human Rights Committee Chair Joanna Cherry (SNP) wants to ensure the Bill does not override the UK's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.Westminster Hall: MPs debate two e-petitions against the compulsory registration of home-schooled children (16:30).Committees: Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:15) questions Secretary of State Michael Gove on co-ordination with the devolved administrations, in a session expected to range across the impact of the Retained EU Law Bill, the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, the Scottish Gender Recognition Reform Bill, and a second independence referendum.Lords: From 14:30, another day in the marathon committee stage on the Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill (which has attracted the nickname the ""Life, the Universe and Everything"" Bill).Tuesday 28 MarchCommons: Justice Questions from 11:30.Ten-minute rule bill: Conservative Dean Russell wants to require consultation before changes to bus services.Main debate: Day two of Committee of the Whole House on the Illegal Migration Bill - including clauses permanently banning people from the UK if they've entered illegally.Westminster Hall: An interesting offering from Lib Dem Christine Jardine (14:30), looking at creating a register for bereaved children to help them deal with potentially lifelong trauma.Committees: Treasury (09:45) quizzes Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey on the stability of the banking sector, following the sale of Silicon Valley Bank UK and the demise of Credit Suisse.Health and Social Care (10:00) opens a new inquiry carefully entitled ""Assisted Dying/Assisted Suicide,"" with a panel of peers who have attempted to legalise it, including the Labour former Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer. Then they hear from experts on palliative care. In February, the committee visited Oregon to look at the working of its Death with Dignity Act.Lords: From 14:30, the first of two days of the report stage consideration of the Energy Bill, another bill that has been in hibernation, having last been debated in September.

"30 June 2021","Settled status: EU citizens urged to apply to stay in UK now or lose rights","Settled status: EU citizens urged to apply to stay in UK now or lose rights30 June 2021ShareShareGetty ImagesEU citizens living in the UK have until the end of Wednesday to apply to stay or lose their rights, under post-Brexit rules introduced by the government. More than 5.6 million applications have been received, but around 400,000 cases are still waiting to be processed.Ministers say anyone who applies on time will have their existing rights protected while their case is heard. Labour says many vulnerable people risk losing access to public services and the deadline should be extended.Under the terms of Britain's departure from the European Union, EU citizens and their families living and working in the UK no longer have an automatic right to do so as freedom of movement has come to an end. EU settlement deadline: Are you registered?Are there many more EU citizens in UK than we thought?Digital border will allow arrivals to be measuredInstead, they have to apply for legal permission to remain under what is known as the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS).People from the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, as well as Switzerland are also affected. Once granted status, applicants can continue to use the NHS, study and access public funds and benefits, as well as travel in and out of the country. 'It doesn't make you feel very welcome'Getty ImagesKate (not her real name) was among the first EU citizens to apply for settled status after Brexit, but she did not, initially, realise she also had to register her two-year-old daughter.The 34-year-old German citizen - who has been living and working in Sheffield for four-and-a-half years - realised her mistake when she saw one of the government's TV ads.But she had to post her daughter's passport to the Home Office to verify her identity and it has been stuck in the system for weeks, meaning she will miss the deadline.""Everyone knew this was coming - campaigners have been talking about this for weeks now,"" says Kate. ""They should extend the deadline. It's just difficult to understand why they are not doing that.""She adds: ""It is very worrying, what if they lose my daughter's passport? ""It doesn't make you feel very welcome.""According to provisional Home Office figures to the end of May, 5,605,800 applications have been received since the scheme opened in March 2019 and 5,271,300 have been finalised.The countries whose nationals have made the highest numbers of applications are Poland (975,000) and Romania (918,000).Of the concluded applications, more than 2.7 million were granted settled status, allowing them permanent leave to remain in the UK.A further 2.2 million were given pre-settled status, meaning they need to reapply after living in the country for five years to gain permanent residence.What is settled status?EU nationals living in the UK have until 30 June to apply to stay in the UK. They can apply for:Settled status - on offer to anyone who can prove that they had been in the UK continuously for five years or more before 31 December 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.75 million people.Pre-settled status - on offer to anyone who had been in the UK for less than five years by the end of 2020. As of 31 May, it has been granted to 2.28 million. They can apply for settled status in future, but there is no guarantee they will get it.Some 94,000 applications have been refused, 72,100 were withdrawn or void and 74,900 were deemed invalid - where the Home Office decides someone is not eligible to apply or has failed to provide sufficient proof of residence.Concerns have been raised that thousands of people could fail to register and lose their rights as a result. Miklos Flora, who lives in Worcester but is originally from Hungary, told Radio 4's PM programme that he has struggled with his application. He said he applied for himself with his Hungarian ID card but then realised his wife's card had expired and he could not proceed with their application as a result. ""With my kids, the problem is they don't have any kind of ID cards so I have been advised from the Citizen's Advice they are going to send me a form that is around 39 pages that we have to fill out and then send by post,"" he told PM. Come Thursday morning, most experts agree that it is highly likely there will be tens if not hundreds of thousands of EU citizens who have suddenly become illegal immigrants. So, at its worst, the relatively straightforward scheme could become a second and larger Windrush scandal - despite it being designed to avoid a repeat of that injustice in which the Home Office failed to recognise the rights of people who had long been living legally in the country. So who's not registered? Children could be a huge group because their parents may not realise they are not British. There may be 130,000 in the benefits system too - and there is anecdotal evidence that even some of the well-heeled may be affected if they are unwittingly relying on an old form of permanent residence. The impact of Brexit on all these people, and others more vulnerable, may only become clear when they go for a job or treatment on the NHS - and find they've got no right to be in the UK at all.Labour's Paul Blonfield, who raised the issue in the House of Commons earlier, said there are ""several potential problems"" not least a significant number of late applications, including from those who cannot get through on helplines.Speaking to Radio 4, he said he has heard from people who have been holding for eight hours for advice and face losing their status and their rights. And he said there are particular concerns about children about  in care with applications not made for about 1200 young people. ""I pressed for the government to do what other European countries have done in relation to UK citizens and that's recognise that we are going through a global pandemic and extend the deadline so these issues can get sorted out,"" he said. ""We need to actively reach out"" to those people who have not applied he said ""because they are the hard to reach groups - those people with language difficulties, perhaps people in care, young people in social care,"" he added.Immigration minister Kevin Foster said ""the overwhelming majority"" of people have now applied and ""there are provisions for late applications where people have reasonable grounds for making one"".""We will take a practical and compassionate approach to those who haven't applied particularly where there may be vulnerabilities or obvious reasonable grounds such as children whose parents may not have applied for them.""He said if people have any concerns about their status come the 1st of July ""the message is simple - don't delay, apply today"". There is ""a range of grant funded support organisations that will help people apply and we have an assisted digital service that people can use if needed"" he added.

"18 March 2022","Cost of living: Cut fuel duty, Welsh Tories tell chancellor","Cost of living: Cut fuel duty, Welsh Tories tell chancellor18 March 2022ShareShareGetty Images Fuel prices have risen sharply in recent weeksThe Welsh Conservatives have called for party colleagues in Westminster to cut fuel duty in next week's spring statement.A spike in world oil prices, prompted by the invasion of Ukraine, has seen petrol and diesel costs spiral.Senedd Tories said a cut could help protect family budgets, but a motoring group questioned if it would be fully passed on.The UK government said it had frozen fuel duty for 12 years in a row.Chancellor Rishi Sunak will announce his spring statement, like a mini-budget, on Wednesday.Petrol prices have continued to rise at forecourts despite oil prices having fallen since the spike earlier this month.How has Ukraine conflict affected petrol prices?Fuel price jump will hit food bills, industry saysPetrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highsOn Wednesday, prices for fuel stood at new records - with an average litre costing 165.40p for petrol and 176.76p for diesel.The AA said it meant that between mid-February and mid-March the cost of filling a typical 55-litre car tank leapt from £81.73 to £90.97.Despite the fall in oil prices there are concerns about the future of the world's oil supply, with the International Energy Agency warning of a potential ""global oil supply shock"" from the war and high commodity prices.Petrol prices include two taxes. Fuel duty is currently charged at 57.95 per litre, with VAT of 20% applied on top.The Welsh Tories did not specify a figure but called for duty to be lowered as prices increased.They argued that the increasing revenue VAT generates from rising prices would make up for the shortfall in cash raised by the exchequer.It is the second time in two weeks that the Welsh Conservatives have tried to pressure party colleagues in Westminster.Last week Tory Members of the Senedd (MSs) voted with Labour and Plaid Cymru MSs in calling for more action to bring Ukrainian refugees to the UK.Peter Fox, finance spokesman and MS for Monmouth, said: ""The fight for freedom is not free and we must do our best to insulate the British people from the worst of it. If we do not, we risk losing their support in this generational battle against tyranny.""The Welsh Conservatives believe that the chancellor's spring statement provides the right opportunity to protect the increasingly tight budget of families and businesses, and this can be done by a progressive cutting of fuel duty.""Any cut to fuel duty would need to be substantial if we are to notice the difference at the pumps.Despite the wholesale cost of petrol falling last week, prices have continued to reach record highs with some forecourts charging £2 a litre.If the daily rise in prices continues, reducing fuel duty by a couple of pence would make little difference to the bills facing families and businesses when they fill the tank.But it is in the gift of the chancellor to determine duty and VAT on fuel, and with pressure from politicians and the public, it is a lever he may be tempted to pull during the spring statement.The Welsh Tories are the latest in the party this week to call for a duty cut.In the House of Commons Tory MP Jake Berry called for a cut to fuel duty, an increase in business mileage rates and a discount to vital fuel users.Mr Sunak said he would bear the suggestions in mind but said the fall in the price of oil showed the ""volatility of the situation we are currently experiencing"".The AA warned that a cut to fuel duty may not be fully felt by consumers.""The chancellor might feel that a cut in fuel duty is likely to be lost in what should be a general fall in pump prices,"" the organisation's Luke Bosdet said.""Anyway, with the fuel retailers' knack of coming up with reasons to hang on to chunks of potential pump-price savings, there's no guarantee that a reduction in fuel duty would be passed on in its entirety to struggling consumers.""A HM Treasury spokeswoman said: ""To keep costs down, fuel duty has been frozen for the 12th year in a row, which will save drivers around £15 every time they fill up their tank compared to pre-2010 plans.""We're providing around £21bn this financial year and next to help families, which also includes cutting the Universal Credit taper rate, freezing alcohol duty and helping households with their energy bills through our £9.1bn Energy Bills rebate.""The Republic of Ireland cut fuel duty earlier this week by 20 cents a litre (17p) for petrol and 15 cents (13p), with the reduction due to be in place until August.Oil price falls below $100 a barrelPetrol prices set to ease after hitting fresh highsPetrol price hits new record above £1.60 a litreFuel price jump will hit food bills, industry saysWalesTaxCost of livingFuelWelsh Conservatives","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-60778562"
"20 December 2022","Rwanda migrant plan is lawful, High Court rules","Rwanda migrant plan is lawful, High Court rules20 December 2022ShareRachel Russell & Jasmine AnderssonBBC NewsShareEPAMembers of the Stand up to Racism protest group outside the Royal Courts of Justice on MondayThe government's plan to deport migrants to Rwanda is lawful, the High Court has ruled.The court ruled on Monday that the scheme did not breach the UN's Refugee Convention or human rights laws.But the cases of eight asylum seekers had not been ""properly considered"" and would need to be reconsidered, judges added.Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she is committed to making the Rwanda policy work. A hearing will take place in January to deal with any appeal applications.Follow live as the High Court rules that Rwanda asylum plan is legalWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Ms Braverman said: ""We have always maintained that this policy is lawful and today the court has upheld this.""I am committed to making this partnership work - my focus remains on moving ahead with the policy as soon as possible and we stand ready to defend against any further legal challenge.""Criticising the government's decision to progress with the plans, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called the policy ""unworkable, extortionate and deeply damaging"".Responding to a statement by Ms Braverman in the Commons, she said: ""Instead of sorting out problems with the asylum system, the Conservatives have put forward a plan which risks making trafficking worse.""But Ms Braverman accused Labour of ""seeking to go behind a decision set out by our independent judiciary to suggest this is an illegitimate scheme"". Former Home Secretary Priti Patel announced the government's plan to deport some people to Rwanda back in April. The first deportation flight, which was due to take off on 14 June, was grounded following a series of objections from lawyers for several asylum seekers, along with the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) and charities Care4Calais and Detention Action.Rishi Sunak said he welcomed the High Court ruling, calling it a ""common sense position"" that was supported by ""the vast majority of the British public"". Speaking to broadcasters during a visit to Riga, Latvia, the prime minister said: ""We've always maintained that our Rwanda policy is lawful, and I'm pleased that was confirmed today.""0:48Watch: Sunak welcomes court ruling that says UK will be able to send some migrants to RwandaAlison Thewliss, the SNP's home affairs spokesperson at Westminster, called the Rwanda plan ""deeply immoral"".She told the Commons: ""Those fleeing war, famine and oppression deserve and need our full support."" Responding to Ms Thewliss, Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick said the plans were designed to ""simplify"" a ""too complicated and too bureaucratic"" immigration system.He said: ""The Scottish government are refusing to take any of the asylum seekers who are arriving in the UK on small boats. That is not right. There is a widening gulf between the actions of the Scottish government and their rhetoric."" Will there be a day when flights depart?This is a major victory for the government because the High Court has found that not only does the law allow ministers to relocate some asylum seekers to another country, for their claims to be dealt with there, but they had also acted rationally in the way they set up the partnership with Rwanda.But will there be a day when flights depart, as the home secretary says she dreams? Appeals are almost inevitable, and it could be months before they are dealt with. Then there could be a further challenge to the Supreme Court, if there's a major dispute about what a particular point of law means. And then... individual migrants earmarked for a flight could try to petition the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg - that's assuming the judgement's ruling that more care needs to be taken on each case doesn't add even more delays.So the government is not putting a timescale on flight for good reason. They're currently winning on the principle of the law - but can they really put it into action before the next general election...?Clare Moseley, founder of refugee charity Care4Calais, called the decision on Monday ""disappointing"".She said: ""People who have suffered the horrors of war, torture and human rights abuses should not be faced with the immense trauma of deportation to a future where we cannot guarantee their safety.""Josie Naughton, chief executive of migrant charity Choose Love, said the ruling ""flies in the face of international commitments and accountability"", adding that campaigners will ""continue to fight"" for the ""human right to seek asylum"".The Labour Party also branded the government's Rwanda plan ""unworkable"" and ""unethical"".James Wilson, deputy director of Detention Action, said: ""We are disappointed that the High Court has found the removal of refugees to an autocratic state which tortures and kills people is lawful. However, we will fight on.""The Rwanda policy is brutal and harmful and we will now consider an appeal against today's judgment.""However, Ms Patel called for ministers to ""press ahead"" with the policy as she welcomed the judgement. She said: ""No single policy will stop the Channel crossings, but this important policy will save lives, help break the business model of the criminal gangs and prevent asylum abuse.""Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter: ""It is welcome news that the High Court has ruled that the Rwanda policy is lawful.""It is one of the only humane ways of dealing with the vile people trafficking gangs who are exploiting so many people.""Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo added: ""We welcome this decision and stand ready to offer asylum seekers and migrants safety and the opportunity to build a new life in Rwanda.""This is a positive step in our quest to contribute innovative, long-term solutions to the global migration crisis.""Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said the Prime Minister welcomed the High Court's ruling.He did not give a timeframe for flights taking off, but added: ""We want to go as quickly as possible.""What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?'I'm fighting to survive in Rwanda'How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Suella BravermanPriti PatelRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64024461"

He has said the prime minister should remain in office, despite being fined over a lockdown party, because of the war in Ukraine.The resignation of Justice Minister Lord Wolfson over the ""Partygate"" scandal leads the Metro. The paper quotes Lord Wolfson, the first government minister to quit because of the affair, criticising ""repeated rule-breaking and breaches of the criminal law in Downing Street"".Other papers lead on government plans that would see cross-Channel migrants flown to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed. The Telegraph says that Home Secretary Priti Patel has flown to Rwandan capital Kigali and will set out details of the agreement later.The scheme will be part of a broader plan to ""take back control of illegal immigration"", the Scottish Daily Mail reports. The paper says other aspects are thought to include a new centre for asylum seekers in North Yorkshire and the Ministry of Defence being handed responsibility for patrolling the Channel.The agreement will see Rwanda paid an initial £120m by the UK, the i reports. The paper also quotes refugee campaigners who have previously called the idea ""dystopian"" and ""inhumane"".The Times Scotland says the scheme will be a trial and that only male migrants will be included because the Home Office ""judges that they are the most likely to be economic migrants"".

"17 January 2020","The week ahead in Parliament","The week ahead in Parliament17 January 2020ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareEPAParliament is not fully back to life, but green shoots are appearing.Next week sees the return of Westminster Hall debates, where MPs can raise issues great and small with ministers, and get a government reply, although nothing is pushed to a vote.And the process of setting up the Commons select committees, electing first the chairs, and then the members, is now under way, with nominations to chair the committees closing on Monday, 27 January, with the elections for that phase of the process on Wednesday, 30 January.Campaigning is already visible, with new MPs being glad-handed by aspiring committee chairs, in person and on social media, at every possible opportunity.Remember, the parties carve up a deal on which party gets to provide the chair for each committee - so for example the Treasury Committee will be provided by the Conservatives, this time around.The carve-up reflects the party make-up of the Commons, so the Conservative election victory means that they get to chair a couple of extra committees - which is bad news for Labour's Lillian Greenwood, who chaired transport before the election, but who will now be replaced by a Conservative MP. Getty ImagesJeremy Hunt is canvassing for votes again - as he seeks election to be chair of the Commons health committeeExpect to see candidates popping up at relevant question times and debates in the coming days, to demonstrate their grasp of their chosen area.They will take every opportunity to woo MPs from other parties - because cross-party support is essential to victory, when your own party is choosing between several of its own members.A developing theme in this new round of elections is of senior ex-ministers, including at least three former cabinet ministers, seeking committee chairs.The most spectacular example is Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary and, more pertinently the longest-serving health secretary, seeking to chair the health committee.This has provoked dark mutterings from his rivals about how he would be ""marking his own homework"" - assessing the success of his tenure in the department, if he won. Also seeking election is ex-Business Secretary Greg Clark (Science and technology) and the ex-Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb (Welsh Affairs). Both are far from veterans, and some critics mutter they might wish to repeat the career trajectory of Nicky (now Baroness) Morgan, who departed the cabinet in 2016 to become chair of the Treasury committee.After an influential stint there, in one of the most important select committee posts, leapt with gazelle-like agility back into Boris Johnson's new government, as culture secretary. It all makes for an entertaining set of elections, in any event. AFP/Getty ImagesMPs will vote on the Queen's SpeechMeanwhile, the final votes on the Queen's Speech take place in the Commons, while peers may well vote to amend the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill (the WAB) in their report stage debates on Monday and Tuesday.No-one should get the idea that their Lordships are seeking to block Brexit, whatever their feelings about it; they are looking at issues around the detail of the bill - notably whether to include guarantees for child refugees (the Dubs amendment), the level of parliamentary scrutiny for post-Brexit trade deals and negotiations with the EU, as the process unfolds, the length of the transitional period after Brexit Day on 31 January and the ability of ministers to direct the courts on the interpretation of EU law.What this will amount to is peers signalling their disquiet on points of detail, and then, probably, the Commons voting to reject their changes. While several little interludes have been set aside to allow ""parliamentary ping-pong"", in which the bill bounces between the Lords and Commons until its final form is agreed.My guess is that, once rebuffed, peers will accept the verdict of the Commons, although they might water down their changes and try again. Meanwhile, the other Brexit development to keep an eye on is the publication of the next wave of Brexit legislation - all kinds of bills are in the pipeline, and some may be published in the coming weeks.Here's my rundown of the week ahead:Monday 20 JanuaryThe Commons opens (14:30) with Education Questions, which may well be followed by the usual post-weekend urgent question or ministerial statement. The day's main event will be final segment of the debate on the Queen's Speech, where the subject will be the economy and jobs.Getty ImagesPeers will continue to scrutinise the Brexit billThere are amendments down from the opposition parties - with Green MP Caroline Lucas regretting a lack of action to address the climate emergency; the SNP and Plaid Cymru regretting the end of free movement and urging that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill should not become law without legislative consent from the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senedd; the Lib Dems reference the climate emergency and social justice and Labour regret the continuation of a decade of austerity. The normal drill is for the Speaker to select the amendments from the official opposition - Labour, and the second largest opposition party, the SNP.He does have the scope to select a further amendment, building on the precedent set by Speaker John Bercow, back in 2013, when he allowed a group of Tory Brexiteers to put down an amendment calling for an EU referendum - but it would probably require exceptional circumstances for him to feel that was justified. In any event, given the government's majority, the amendments will not succeed.In the Lords (14:30) questions to minister range across human rights in Indian-administered Kashmir, the treatment of Uighurs in China, the commencement of operations of the Office for Environmental Protection and plans to replace the proposed UK Holocaust Memorial with a national memorial to all victims of extermination or genocide.Then comes the first day of report stage consideration of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill - this is the point at which serious attempts to amend the bill will commence.What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?It is likely to include an attempt by the super lawyers to amend the section giving ministers the power to direct the courts on interpretation of the law. Tuesday 21 JanuaryThe Commons day opens (11:30) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions.Then comes the second reading of the Agriculture (Direct Payments to Farmers Legislative Continuity) Bill. This is an interim measure to ensure that farming subsidies continue to flow immediately after Brexit, confirming the same level of funding to devolved governments for direct payments for 2020 as for 2019.(This is not to be confused with the much more ambitious Agriculture Bill, which will create a new system of farm support, moving away from direct payments in England towards an approach where farmers are paid public money for ""public goods"" like improved air and water quality, tackling climate change or animal welfare.)Getty ImagesThe second reading of the Agriculture (direct payments to farmers legislative continuity) Bill will take place in the CommonsThat will be followed by a debate on the phase one report of the Grenfell Inquiry, which looked at the causes of the fire and recommended safety measures for tower blocks. Meanwhile, debates return to Westminster Hall, starting (09:30) with the Conservative, John Redwood, on growth strategy for the UK.Other subjects for debate include the contribution of music to the economy and society, led by Labour MP Conor McGinn.He wants to highlight the UK music industry's £5.2bn contribution to the economy last year, and the challenges it faces around Brexit, at grassroots level - including maintaining local venues and supporting artists - and in promoting and teaching music in schools.In the Lords, peers start early (11:00) to give themselves extra time for report stage consideration of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill. MPs reject call to reinstate child refugee pledgeThey break at 14:30 for their usual question time, which will include the former Sea Lord, Lord West of Spithead, asking about the power generation problems affecting Type 45 destroyers, a question on how a federal or confederal system of government could be implemented in the UK, and on a strategy for dealing with alcohol abuse. After half an hour, the report stage consideration of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill continues, including, probably an amendment from Labour's Lord Dubs and his allies to restore the child refugee provisions contained in an earlier version of the bill.1:02Lord Dubs: Allowing child refugees to be reunited with their families is the ""very minimum"" UK can do after BrexitThat will be followed by what may be a rather perfunctory third reading debate (amendments at this stage are rare, but not completely unheard of) after which the bill will be sent off to the Queen, to be signed into law, if unchanged, or, if amended, back to the Commons to allow MPs to approve or reject any changes made by peers. Wednesday 22 January The Commons day opens (11:30) with questions to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, arguably the second most important member of the government.EPAMPs will quiz Michael GoveAt 12:00 comes Prime Minister's Question Time, now restored to its traditional half-hour duration. The day's main legislating is on the second reading of the the Telecoms Infrastructure Leasehold Property Bill.This provides a bespoke process for telecoms network operators to gain access to blocks of residential flats and apartments to deploy, upgrade or maintain fixed-line broadband connections, where a tenant has requested the service but the landlord has repeatedly failed to respond. There's also an hour set aside for consideration of and Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill - such a short debating slot that it suggests that almost any change their Lordships have proposed will be rejected out of hand. In Westminster Hall, debates include South Yorkshire Mayor Dan Jarvis (who remains an MP) on national productivity (09:30).After the election I highlighted Mr Jarvis as an MP to watch, making the case for more devolution within England to boost the economy; Labour MP Sarah Champion (11:00) raises the safety of all-lane running schemes on motorways.She will argue the schemes pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of road users and that the government has placed lives in jeopardy in the name of cost savings.Rotherham man Jason Mercer was killed last summer on the South Yorkshire stretch of ALR motorway.She will call for the rollout of ALR motorways to be halted and for immediate safety improvements on existing schemes so we do not see more deaths.Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, will lead a debate on the report of the Commission on Justice in Wales (16:30).She will argue that the current devolution settlement hampers crime prevention, because the law and order agencies are run from London, while the social services side of the equation is devolved; she says this bolsters the case for devolution of policing and justice to Cardiff. In the Lords (15:00) questions cover banning expiry dates on gift vouchers, bringing to justice those responsible for violence against journalists and the review of the continuation of the BBC licence fee at the next BBC charter review.Then, there's provision in the agenda to consider any Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill - the expectation is that if MPs refuse to accept any changes made by peers, this is the point at which their resistance will crumble, and the government will get its way.Peers will then deal with a pair of justice orders and regulations: the Release of Prisoners (Alteration of Relevant Proportion of Sentence) Order 2019, and the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 (Consequential Amendment) Regulations 2019.The purpose of these is to push back the point at which offenders sentenced to standard determinate sentences must be automatically released, from halfway through their sentence, to the two-thirds point.The government says its intention is to provide robust sentences for dangerous and serious offenders ensure that the time they spend in custody reflects the severity of their crimes and takes account of the risk they pose to the public.There's even a select committee hearing - I think the first public evidence-taking of the new Parliament, as the Lords International Relations and Defence Committee (10:10) opens its inquiry into sub-Saharan Africa.Giving evidence are former Secretary of State for International Development Andrew Mitchell MP and Labour's David Lammy, who will discuss how the UK's colonial history affects perceptions of sub-Saharan Africa. Thursday 23 JanuaryMPs begin their day (09:30) with half an hour of International Trade Questions, after which the Secretary of State, Elizabeth Truss, stays at the Despatch Box for more questions, in her other role as Minister for Women and Equalities. EPAElizabeth Truss will be at the despatch box taking questions from MPsNext comes the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, with the weekly statement on forthcoming Commons Business.The main event will be the annual debate to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.In the Lords (11:00) the day begins with the introduction of another new peer, the Appeal Court judge, Baroness Hallett, who will sit as a crossbencher.Questions to ministers range across the environmental aspects of government trade policy, legislation to match the US government's sanctions powers, reducing homelessness and government policy on sanctions in Syria.That is followed by a 20-minute question time for the Culture Secretary, Nicky (now Baroness) Morgan, following the precedent set Lord Adonis and Lord Mandelson who were departmental ministers sitting in the Lords under Gordon Brown.The question time will be a regular event for as long as Baroness Morgan continues in the role. Then peers will debate two select committee reports, first on ""Fisheries: implementation and enforcement of the EU landing obligation and The EU fisheries landing obligation: six months on"" and then on the report from the Economic Affairs Committee: ""Rethinking High Speed 2"", which argued that the government should prioritise spending on transport infrastructure in the north of England over the controversial high speed rail project.With a report on HS2 from the financial watchdog, the National Audit Office due soon, a lively debate on the future of the scheme is going to be a major theme of the next few parliamentary months.The speakers list includes the former Transport Secretary, Lord Adonis, one of HS2's strongest supporters.

"30 March 2021","Charity warns UK aid priorities to see 63% cut in funding","Charity warns UK aid priorities to see 63% cut in funding30 March 2021ShareJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentShareCrown CopyrightThe government's priorities for foreign aid spending this year face a funding cut of up to 63 per cent, according to analysis by an international anti-poverty charity.The One Campaign said existing commitments meant the government would be unable to protect its aid spending on areas like girls' education and humanitarian aid.The government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7 per cent of national income to just 0.5 per cent, a reduction of more than £4bn.It has yet to say where the axe will fall, but it has set out its broad priorities for the £10bn remaining in the aid budget.They include Covid and global health security, girls' education, science and technology, strengthening democracy, humanitarian aid and boosting economic infrastructure.Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budgetYemen aid cut condemned by charitiesDecision to cut UK aid budget unlawful, says peerBut analysis by the ONE Campaign - the global health and anti-poverty group founded by the U2 singer Bono - suggests even these priorities face spending cuts of up to 63 per cent.That's because much of the aid budget will be consumed by long term commitments the government has already made and would find it hard to avoid.The government has promised to spend £11.6bn of overseas aid over the next five years tackling climate change. It says it wants to remain the largest donor to the World Bank.It promised in the Brexit withdrawal agreement to continue funding existing EU development programmes.It remains committed to funding the international Global Fund organisation that tackles diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as the global vaccine alliance - Gavi.And there are also commitments to spend overseas assistance on supporting refugees in the UK.MODUK Aid is sent across the world in the immediate aftermath of natural disastersThe ONE Campaign calculates all these commitments will cost £6.3bn in 2021. And that would leave just £3.8bn left for the government's bilateral priorities. That amounts to a 63 per cent cut from the equivalent £9.4bn that was spent in 2019.The charity said this could leave nine million women and children at risk of malnutrition in Nigeria or 1.5 million women losing access to family planning in Ethiopia.Romilly Greenhill, UK Director of The ONE Campaign, said: ""These are the countries we're meant to be building bridges with, our new trading partners. Instead, we're turning our backs on the most vulnerable all while trying to claim we're leading the world in tackling global challenges."" She added: ""These cuts would hit doubly hard because so much of the aid budget is already tied up on long-standing commitments, meaning the amount left for discretionary spending is significantly lower than expected.""To put it simply, it will be extremely difficult for the Government to make the proposed cuts, whilst also protecting their priority areas - health and education - in 2021. This means sliding backwards on the exact issues that have been hit hardest by the pandemic.""A spokesman for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""We will spend more than £10 billion this year to fight poverty, tackle climate change and improve global health - making us one of the world's biggest aid donors.""The impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. We are still working through what this means for individual programmes.""Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budgetYemen aid cut condemned by charitiesConservative PartyForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeUK aidInternational aid","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56576850"

He told the BBC there was ""no justification for the withholding of essential supplies"" from the people of Gaza. His comments came amid resignations within the party over Sir Keir Starmer's stance on the crisis.The Labour leader has repeatedly insisted Israel has a right to defend itself within international law.More than 1,400 Israelis have been killed since Hamas launched its attack on 7 October, according to Israeli authorities - the vast majority in the initial assault. More than 220 are believed to have been taken hostage inside Gaza.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 5,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel's air strikes began in response, and according to the Palestinian health ministry in the occupied West Bank, 91 Palestinians have been killed there since 7 October.Fifteen Labour officers resign over Gaza policyStarmer condoned war crimes, says former Labour MPStarmer writes to Labour councillors over Gaza stanceSpeaking after an Institute for Government event in London, Mr Sarwar said: ""There is no justification for the withholding of essential supplies; water, electricity, medicine and food from the people of Gaza. It is a clear breach of international law.""""There is no grey area. International law is clear. Withholding of water, energy and essential supplies is a breach of international law and therefore there must be a immediate humanitarian corridor opened so that is accessed by the people in Gaza.""He said he made his remarks ""whilst unequivocally condemning Hamas"" and called for ""a de-escalation of violence"" and the end of  ""rocket fire coming into and out of Gaza"".""We must condemn Hamas but we cannot pretend that Hamas is the Palestinian people,"" he added.Labour resignationsMr Sarwar's comments come amid a number of resignations of Labour party members and elected officials across the UK, including 15 officials in Scotland.Nine officers in a Glasgow ward, including a Labour peer, and six in Edinburgh stood down earlier this week.The Glasgow Kelvin officers accused Scottish Labour of ""stifling democracy"" after a motion calling for an end to military action was ruled out of order.Asked about Labour officers resigning their positions in Glasgow and Edinburgh constituency Labour parties (CLPs), Mr Sarwar said he disputed claims the party was stifling debate.""I don't want to trivialise the issue by talking about individual CLPs… it's being talked about nationally and right across the country,"" he said.'A right to defend herself'Two councillors who resigned from the party in Oxford have objected to comments made by Sir Keir on a radio programme earlier this month.Pressed at the time on whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, he said: ""I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation.""Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself,"" he added.Sir Keir later clarified those comments by explaining he was speaking about Israel's right to defend itself, not to cut off power and water, and that Israel should respond within international law.PA MediaThe crisis in the Middle East has led to protests in the UK and abroadMeanwhile, the first minister has said his mother-in-law, who is stuck in Gaza, has ""lost hope"".Elizabeth El-Nakla and her husband Maged travelled to the region before the Hamas attack and subsequent Israeli reprisals left them trapped.In a statement in the Scottish Parliament, Humza Yousaf reiterated calls for a ceasefire, an increase in aid and a global refugee settlement scheme to be created for those who wish to flee.Speaking about his in-laws, Mr Yousaf said he and his wife Nadia could barely sleep for worry.""Throughout the day, the 100 people in the family home must ration their food. The adults barely eat, my mother-in-law only ate cashew nuts yesterday, they ration so the children in the house don't end up malnourished, but time is running out,"" he said.""I spoke to my mother-in-law this morning.

Mr Austin told the Express & Star newspaper, which first broke news of his resignation, that it was the ""most difficult decision"" he had ever had to take. Who is Ian Austin? Who are the new independent MPs?What does it feel like to quit a party?The MP, who has represented the West Midlands constituency since 2005, later told BBC West Midlands that he was ""ashamed"" of the party.""I grew up listening to my dad, who was a refugee from the Holocaust, teaching me about the evils of hatred and prejudice,"" he said.""One of the main reasons I joined the Labour Party as a teenager here in Dudley more than 35 years ago was to fight racism and I could never have believed I would be leaving the Labour party because of racism too.""Analysis: Push and pull for Labour MPs malcontentsBy political correspondent Jonathan BlakeGetty ImagesIan Austin (right), campaigning with Harriet Harman and John Prescott in 2010Another MP resigns, pouring scathing criticism on their leader at the end of a watershed week at Westminster.Ian Austin's decision not to join his former colleagues in the new Independent Group is telling. It shows that he felt strongly enough about the problem of anti-Semitism within Labour to quit the party he has been a member of for 45 years on that basis alone. But it also suggests that Parliament's newest group may be seen above all for what, in the absence of any policies, unites them. That is support for a further referendum on leaving the EU, something Ian Austin would not sign up to. For him the push from a party in which he no longer felt at home was more powerful that the pull of life in a new party on the outside. Other Labour and Conservative MPs who are considering their future will also need to decide whether they're better off out than in, and whether the Independent Group is the place for them. Explaining his decision not to call a by-election, Mr Austin said he had been openly critical of Mr Corbyn during the 2017 election campaign.  He said his ""work for the people in this community is going to carry on as it always has"". Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by his close friend's decision to leave.""I didn't want him to go, not just because he is a friend but because Labour needs people of his experience, calibre and passion if we are to win,"" he added.Mr Watson recently said Labour had been slow to deal with the anti-Semitism row and he ""no longer recognises"" the party .But Mr Corbyn, who has been in Madrid for a meeting of European socialists, took issue with Mr Watson's comments and said he would talk to him about them in the ""near future"".The Labour leader told Sky News: ""There is no place for harshness, bullying or anything else in the party. I don't believe that it exists on a wide scale.""Where there is bad behaviour we deal with it. Where there is a problem we deal with it.""'Zero tolerance'Derby North MP Chris Williamson, a close ally of Mr Corbyn, said his departure was ""no loss"".Describing Mr Austin as ""stuck in the 1990s... a New Labour relic"", he told the BBC: ""I for many years wasn't particularly a fan of Tony Blair, but I didn't throw my toys out of the pram.""Mr Austin ""fought the last election under false pretences"", using Labour's brand to get elected, Mr Williamson added.Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 monthsCorbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish groupIn an interview with London's Evening Standard, conducted before Mr Austin's resignation, shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people behaving in a way ""construed as anti-Semitic"" that: ""They will be dealt with. Full stop. They are not welcome.""He admitted the leadership let down Jewish MP Luciana Berger, who described the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" when leaving to join the Independent Group.There was not enough support for Ms Berger, ""not enough action"", Mr McDonnell said, before pledging to ""sort it"".Mr Austin was a minister for regional affairs under Gordon Brown and part of Ed Miliband's front-bench team in opposition.He said he ""agreed"" with the eight MPs who left Labour to form the Independent Group earlier this week that things ""have got to change"".However, he wants a Brexit deal concluded, rather than a further referendum on EU membership.While Mr Austin did not rule out joining the group, he told BBC Radio 5 Live he was ""not anticipating doing that any time soon"".Ms Berger tweeted that she fully understood why he had come to ""this difficult and painful decision"" of leaving Labour.Another of the defectors, Chuka Umunna, tweeted his ""massive respect"" to Mr Austin, adding: ""It's painful and hard but he has stayed true to his values and what he believes to be the national interest.""The MPs leaving their partiesCorbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish groupWhat does it feel like to quit a party?Shadow cabinet clash over anti-SemitismLabour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47330079"

believed to include offering a new Parliamentary motion if the Brexit deal is voted down by MPs and peers - may have avoided defeat on the key demand for a ""meaningful vote"".Live updates: MPs debate EU bill changesMinister quits government over BrexitHow big a problem is Lee's resignation for May?The Brexit amendments MPs are voting onEarlier, starting the Commons debate, Mr Davis told MPs the bill's ""primary purpose"" was to ensure a ""functioning statute book"" on the day the UK leaves the EU, 29 March 2019.The most tightly-contested amendment is likely to be the call for Parliament to decide what happens next if MPs decide they do not like the UK-EU Brexit deal.0:54Stand up for what you believe in - Tory MPMr Davis said this would represent a ""profound constitutional shift"" and that the government, not Parliament, should be in charge of international negotiations.Tory MP Sir Edward Leigh agreed, saying the change would amount to a ""wrecking of the will of the people"", and Sir Bill Cash said it was ""just a cover for a reversal of the decision"" to leave the EU.But pro-EU Conservative veteran Ken Clarke criticised ""real zealots"" who were trying to ""stop this Parliament playing any part in the process"".The government's offer to make a statement if the Brexit deal was not approved by MPs would amount to saying ""Oh House of Commons, get lost"", he claimed.3:13Speaker John Bercow tells MPs not to be intimidatedAnother likely Tory rebel, Anna Soubry, criticised some of her Conservative colleagues, saying their ""life's ambition"" was to take the UK ""over the cliff to the hard Brexit"".Ms Soubry also raised threats made to MPs over the issue, saying one of her colleagues needed six armed protection officers when attending a public event.As the debate continued, the government tried to convince potential rebels to back down, with Solicitor General Robert Buckland offering to hold talks with one of them, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, on Wednesday.Minister resigns over BrexitAFPMr Lee has called for a referendum on the final Brexit dealPhillip Lee has been a junior justice minister since July 2016, having first been elected as the Bracknell MP in 2010.Explaining the reasons for his resignation, he cited the government's opposition to the ""meaningful vote"" amendment, saying this position ""breaches fundamental principles of human rights and Parliamentary sovereignty"".He also raised concerns about the economic impact of leaving the EU, saying Brexit had turned out to be much more complicated than first thought.The UK should ""pause, extend or revoke"" the Article 50 process which formally triggered its departure from the EU, he said, calling for another referendum once ministers' chosen path becomes clear.Pro-EU campaigners hailed his resignation as significant in their calls for a referendum on the UK and EU's final Brexit deal.Brexit-backing former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said he was surprised, adding: ""I didn't realise he felt this strongly.""Mr Duncan Smith said the amendment giving more power to Parliament would be ""disastrous"" and allow the House of Lords to ""block the whole passage of Brexit"".Final say for Parliament?Brexit Secretary tells Today the EU referendum is ""irreversible""BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the numbers were still ""rather dicey"" for the so-called meaningful vote amendment.It would mean ministers ""must follow any direction"" set by a House of Commons motion if Parliament rejects the final Brexit deal or negotiations run out of time.The government says this would bind the UK's hands in the negotiations.Brexit: All you need to knowWhy is the customs union so important?Flashpoints ahead for the Brexit billSpeaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Davis said a Parliamentary vote on the Brexit deal did not give ""the ability to reverse the decision of the referendum"".Asked what would happen if MPs rejected the deal, he said there would be no time to restart negotiations, with the UK leaving the EU in March 2019.""If they throw it out, well they throw it out,"" he said.Rebels have dismissed the government's amendment, a commitment by ministers to make a statement within 28 days should MPs vote down the package negotiated by Mrs May.Customs compromise deal?Pro and anti-Brexit protesters demonstrated outside Parliament ahead of the votesA showdown over customs seems to have been averted after a compromise amendment was accepted by the government - which means it has agreed to report to Parliament by October on efforts to negotiate a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU after Brexit.The fallback position has won the backing of a cross-section of leading Tory MPs on either side of the Brexit argument, avoiding for now a showdown over calls - backed by the House of Lords earlier this year - for the UK to remain in a fully-fledged customs union with the EU after it leaves. Mr Davis said a ""great deal of progress"" had been made in negotiations, saying he was expecting both a withdrawal agreement and the ""substance"" of the UK and EU's future relationship to be finalised in October.He also described as ""nonsense"" reports he threatened to resign over the wording of last week's ""backstop"" plan to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland.A big week for BrexitWhat is the EU customs union?The EU withdrawal bill is the legislation aimed at ensuring the UK has a smooth transition out of the EU, and will mean EU law is no longer supreme in the UK.To avoid a sudden ""cliff edge"" on Brexit day, 29 March 2019, it would also convert existing EU law into UK law so the government and Parliament can decide at a later date which bits they want to keep or change.The House of Lords has put forward 15 specific changes to the bill, but the government wants to kill off most of these changes.However, numbers in the House of Commons are finely balanced, with the Conservatives not having a majority and needing the help of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to get their way. May: Send the EU a messageOn Monday, Mrs May told her MPs they ""must think about the message Parliament will send to the European Union this week"".""I am confident I can get a deal that allows us to strike our own trade deals while having a border with the EU which is as frictionless as possible,"" she said.""But if the Lords amendments are allowed to stand, that negotiating position will be undermined.""

Labour, which is backing 14 out of the 15 amendments, is urging Tory rebels to seize the chance to ""decisively shape the course of the negotiations"".Jeremy Corbyn's party is also divided on Brexit, with several MPs unhappy Labour is not backing a bid to keep the UK part of the EU's single market, like Norway.Laura Kuenssberg: Squeaky moment or not? There is still a chance of a squeaky moment for the government, or having to rely on votes from some Labour MPs, on a move to give Parliament more power if MPs vote to reject the final Brexit deal.Sources tell me the numbers are still rather dicey for that so called ""meaningful vote"" amendment that will take place tomorrow. There are discussions ongoing among potential rebels about whether they should deploy their forces. Some of them believe, as they do on the customs issue, that they have the numbers to beat the government if they decide it's the right moment. Appeals for party unity in the last couple of days, and the compromise on customs seem to have had some sway. Read Laura's full blogThe key dates ahead on Brexit

What MPs will be voting onThe government opposes the following Lords amendments:Granting new powers to oversee changes made to EU law by the governmentRemoving the precise day of Brexit from the wording of the billRemoving a section allowing ministers to use secondary legislation to establish when individuals can challenge the validity of retained EU law after exitOnly let ministers use delegated powers to amend retained EU law where ""necessary"" Preventing ministers from using delegated powers to implement the UK-EU Withdrawal AgreementMake staying in the European Economic Area, like Norway, a ""negotiating objective"" for the UKTransferring the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights into UK lawAllowing ""enhanced scrutiny"" when ministers use delegated powers to change EU employment, equality health and safety, consumer and environment rulesThe government has proposed its own version of these ones:Giving Parliament the power to decide what happens if MPs and peers reject the final Brexit dealExplicitly preserving cooperation between Northern Ireland and the Republic and commit to no new border arrangements without the agreement of the UK and Irish governmentsAllowing people to challenge UK law if it fails to comply with the general principles of EU lawForcing ministers to maintain EU environmental principles in domestic law after BrexitCompelling ministers to aim for a deal allowing unaccompanied child refugees to join relatives in the UKThe government has accepted this amendment:Allowing the UK to replicate EU law made after Brexit day and continue to participate in EU agenciesThe government is backing a compromise backbench amendment on this:Forcing the government to report on ""steps taken to negotiate a customs union with the EU"" by 31 October","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44446633"
"31 October 2020","The week ahead in Parliament","The week ahead in Parliament31 October 2020ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentSharePA MediaThey're back! I think it would be a rather foolhardy MP who used the half-term break in Commons action to top up their tan, or hit the ski slopes.I suspect most were putting themselves about in their constituencies, and that this will lead to a lot of pointed interventions in the chamber about what they did and what they saw while the House wasn't sitting. Expect the week to start with plenty of ministerial statements, updating MPs on the latest pandemic and Brexit developments - with the strong possibility that the regulations underpinning local moves to higher-tier restrictions will be put before them. This could mean some pretty uncomfortable debates for the government.Meanwhile, Brexit rumbles on, with peers tooling up to fillet out key parts of the UK Internal Market Bill, amidst an unusually high level of cross-party cooperation between the bill's many opponents. I don't expect hostile amendments to be passed this week, but, come 9 November, peers may take the unusual step of passing amendments at Committee Stage - signalling real problems for ministers in getting this measure through before the end of the Brexit transitional period, on 31 December. Unless, of course, a deal with the EU gets them off the hook.Elsewhere, here are five other things to keep an eye on: Kings of the North - the Conservative backbench Northern Research Group is emerging as an interesting new player in the Commons; the title deliberately echoes the highly successful Brexiteer guerrilla operation that is the European Research Group, and the aim is to press for a bigger share of the cake for the Conservatives' new ""Red Wall"" seats, although this could end up being at the expense of traditional blue heartlands, and there's the rub. Ringmastering operations is the former minister for the Northern Powerhouse, Jake Berry, who aims to make a well-researched case for greater investment in infrastructure in those areas. There's a pleasingly 'Game of Thrones' vibe to the whole exercise.Select Committee cull - with the annexation of the Department for International Development by the Foreign Office, the Commons International Development Committee, currently led by Labour's Sarah Champion, is set to disappear at the end of December, leaving Tom Tugendhat's Foreign Affairs Committee to scrutinise aid spending. At some point, the same fate will befall Hilary Benn's Brexit Committee. It's possible this may lead to some rejigging of the remits of other committees, but it also leaves Labour two committee chairs down in the share-out agreed after the last election, which is supposed to reflect the strength of the parties in the Commons. Will a Tory incumbent chair be asked to walk the plank to redress the balance? Bong! - not heard since it rang in the new year in 2019, Big Ben (the great bell in the Elizabeth Tower) will be heard in test chimes to prepare for the Remembrance Day ceremony on Sunday 8 November, when it will ring out at 11:00 GMTAgile Opposition Days - Labour's last-minute change of subject in their Opposition Day debate on 21 October led to a bruising Commons afternoon discussing the extension of free school meals, as advocated by footballer Marcus Rashford. The move was vindicated by a mini-rebellion on the Conservative side, and continuing hostile press coverage. But it was a bit of a breach of normal etiquette to change the subject at short notice, so I wonder if the government whips might find a way to extract some payback?Object lessons - a series of Commons divisions on Covid regulations were forced by the Conservative William Wragg, who shouted ""object"" when the government attempted to get them through on the nod. Mr Wragg is a strong critic of the current government strategy, and an ex-whip who knows all the tricks; will there be more to come?Monday 2 November MPs return to their Chamber (14:30 GMT) for Defence Questions, probably to be followed by ministerial statements updating the House on Brexit and the progress of the pandemic.That's followed by a general debate on Covid-19, which, depending on events, could be mundane or pretty spicy. And there's an interesting-looking adjournment debate from Labour's Yvette Cooper, on support for rugby league during the Covid-19 outbreak.In Westminster Hall (16:30), there's a debate on an online petition calling for a ban on selling fireworks to the public, which attracted 305,579 signatures. After that, (18:00) they turn to another petition, which urges no prosecution for parents that remove children from school during a pandemic. The petitioners want a law to allow parents to remove their children from school under such circumstances, without negative action by schools or local authorities, like the loss of the child's place in the school or even prosecution. This one attracted 100,649 signatures. On the committee corridor, Public Accounts (14:30) takes evidence on specialist skills in the civil service, with Alex Chisholm, the Chief Operating Officer for the Civil Service and other top officials. And Housing, Communities and Local Government opens its new inquiry into supporting High Streets with evidence from the Retail Consortium and the Royal Town Planning Institute (16:00).PA MediaHigh streets have been hit hard by Covid restrictions and shutdowns this year.In the Lords (13:00), ministers face questions about the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the publication date for the report of the government's investigation into bullying allegations against the home secretary, the 2042 target date for the restoring 75 per cent of terrestrial and freshwater protected sites to a favourable condition, and a fairer settlement for developing countries who lose out from tax avoidance by multinational corporations. Then it's on to the main event, the third day of committee stage scrutiny of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill.The focus this week will be details on the Competition and Markets Authority, the independence of the Office for the Internal Market and the financial assistance powers in the bill.Tuesday 3 NovemberMPs open (11:30) with Justice Questions, followed by a ten-minute rule bill from former cabinet minister Chris Grayling on labelling food for environmental sustainability. The main legislative action is the report and third reading stages of the Overseas Operations (Service Personnel and Veterans) Bill, the measure to provide a ""triple lock"" against prosecutions of service personnel for human rights violations. Labour has a series of amendments down.There are also amendments proposed by Labour MP Harriet Harman, chair of the Human Rights Committee, which would remove the presumption against prosecution which is a key feature of the bill. Kevan Jones, a former Labour defence minister and now a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, has also proposed amendments to bring in judicial oversight of historic investigations of service personnel.In Westminster Hall (09:30), Jeremy Corbyn will make what could be his first appearance as an independent MP, following the withdrawal of the Labour whip, during a debate on the Rohingya refugee crisis and the impact of the pandemic.In the Lords (12:00), questions to ministers cover the government's integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy, as well as standards for qualifications. Quite an interesting internal debate follows, on the report from the Conduct Committee entitled ""Valuing Everyone training; ICGS investigations - former MPs"".This is about closing a loophole in the system which means that allegations, for example, of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct, against peers, which date from their time as MPs, cannot be investigated by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. The plan is that such allegations should be investigated under Commons, not Lords procedures.Peers will then consider the Commons Reasons on the Prisoners (Disclosure of Information About Victims) Bill - the main ping-pong issue has been the Parole Database - but no vote is expected, which suggests agreement or at least acquiescence by a Lords majority.Wednesday 4 NovemberMPs open (11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time. The day's ten-minute rule bill, from the SNP's Gavin Newlands, is an attempt to outlaw ""fire and re-hire"" tactics by companies seeking to cut pay and conditions for staff.The next business is two sets of Lords amendments, first to the Agriculture Bill, where peers continue to insist that new trade agreements should require imported food to meet UK standards. They also want reports published on the impact of new trade agreements on agri-foods (they've dropped their call for the agreements to be policed by the Trade and Agriculture Commission).Next up are amendments to the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill, where the issues include the right to family reunion and the treatment of victims of modern slavery.PA MediaThe Agriculture Bill has prompted protests in Westminster from farmers' groups.In Westminster Hall, the Conservative Pauline Latham, a member of the International Development Committee, leads a debate (09:30) on sexual exploitation and abuse perpetrated by international peacekeepers and staff of non-governmental organisations. Attention to this issue really began after the Oxfam sexual misconduct scandal in 2018. On the committee corridor, Environmental Audit (14:00) takes evidence on the energy efficiency of homes. In the Lords (12:00), ministers face questions on the support to accompany the new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth's deployment to the South China Sea in 2021 - that's from former admiral, Lord West of Spithead. Further questions cover the union between Scotland and the rest of the UK and ensuring changes to the planning system will deliver more accessible homes for people with disabilities. Then it's back to the committee stage of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill. Thursday 5 NovemberThe Commons meets (09:30) for forty minutes of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General, and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House. The remainder of the day is devoted to two debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee, on the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemes, and on the UK's role in ensuring innovation and equitable access within the Covid-19 response. On the Committee Corridor, Public Accounts (10:00) quizzes the permanent secretary at the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar, and others about the Covid-19 Bounce Back Loan Scheme for businesses. The Lords is not expected to sit - peers may not get a Commons-style week off, but they are having a long weekend. Friday 6 NovemberMPs meet at 09:30 to debate private members' bills, starting with the second reading of Labour MP Paula Barker's National Minimum Wage Bill. This aims to tighten up enforcement of the national minimum wage by, for example, requiring employers to keep detailed records, and in particular to end what she calls the scandal of domiciliary - or homecare - workers being discriminated against and denied their full entitlement under the law. This often happens in the form of employees not being paid properly for so-called 'travel time' between individual home care visits.Next up is the Trade Agreements (Exclusion of National Health Services) Bill, from the SNP's Peter Grant, which aims to prevent trade agreements leading to more privatisation in the NHS. As ever, there are plenty more bills on the Order Paper - Peter Bone's Prime Minister (Temporary Replacement) Bill looks rather topical after Boris Johnson's incapacitation with Covid-19 earlier this year - but the likelihood is that there won't be time to discuss any of them. And there could be a great deal of filibustering. I have the distinct impression that new Conservative MPs are being encouraged to contribute to Friday debates which give them a rare opportunity to make a speech that is more than three minutes long.

Unlike other parties, we do not want to simply cede all powers to equally distant political elites in Westminster,"" he added.UKIP says it would hold a referendum on the future of the Welsh Parliament ""immediately"" within the next term.It said it was the ""first anti-devolution party that will set a firm timeline for scrapping the Senedd"".In place of the law-making parliament in Cardiff Bay, UKIP says it would set up directly-elected health boards and ""self-governing"" grammar and free schools.At the launch Mr Hamilton also defended a candidate who had sent offensive messages about Muslims on Twitter.WALES ELECTION: THE BASICSWhat elections are happening? On 6 May, people across Wales will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party or parties that can command the support of a majority of members will form the Welsh government.

"21 February 2024","David Neal: Immigration and borders watchdog sacked for leaking critical reports","David Neal: Immigration and borders watchdog sacked for leaking critical reports21 February 2024ShareCallum MayBBC NewsSharePA MediaDavid Neal ""lost the confidence of the home secretary""Home Secretary James Cleverly has sacked the government's immigration watchdog after details of critical reports appeared in newspapers.The Home Office said David Neal had ""breached the terms"" of his role and leaked confidential information.Mr Neal was quoted in The Daily Mail about security checks on private jets.Meanwhile, sources close to him said he was responsible for details of another unpublished report about visas for care workers appearing in The Times.The comments made by Mr Neal in the Mail triggered an urgent question in Parliament on Tuesday, with immigration minister Tom Pursglove telling the Commons the Home Office ""categorically"" rejected claims that hundreds of high-risk flights had landed in the UK without security checks.Mr Neal told the paper he had seen Home Office data suggesting that 21% of private jets classified as high risk, which came into London City Airport, were inspected by immigration officials last year. ""This is a scandal, and incredibly dangerous for this country's border security"", he was quoted as saying.But Mr Pursglove said UK Border Force performed checks on ""100% of scheduled passengers arriving in the UK and risk-based intelligence-led checks on general aviation"".He added that an issue with the data meant some flights had been classified as high-risk when they should have been low-risk.He described it as ""deeply disturbing that information which has no basis in fact was leaked by the independent chief inspector to a national newspaper before the Home Office had the chance to respond"".A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We have terminated the appointment of David Neal, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration (ICBI), after he breached the terms of appointment and lost the confidence of the home secretary. ""The planned recruitment process for the next ICBI is in progress.""Mr Neal, whose tenure was due to end on 21 March, told the Times on Tuesday that he had not made the decision to speak to the media ""lightly"". He added: ""But I've been forced into this because my reports aren't being published.""""I've spent all my working life protecting this country, I've identified a security failing and I've brought it back to the Home Office,"" he is quoted as saying.  ""There's a strong public interest here and that's why I've done what I've done. The border is there to keep us safe, it's critical that there are clear auditable risk decisions made to protect every one of us in the country.""Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who tabled the question, said this was an example of ""total Tory chaos on borders and immigration"".""A series of Conservative home secretaries have sought to bury uncomfortable truths revealed by the chief inspector about our broken borders, and shockingly they are still sitting on 15 unpublished reports - stretching back to April last year,"" she said.Ms Cooper also called on Mr Cleverly to ""publish those reports in full"".The government website lists 14 ICIBI inspection reports that are awaiting publication. Ms Cooper's office is understood to be including the inspector's annual report in the total.The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael also called for the reports to be published ""without delay"". ""This is a desperate move from a Conservative government terrified of proper scrutiny of their record of failure on borders and immigration,"" he added.Mr Neal is a former army officer who commanded a brigade of the Royal Military Police. The report about the social care system - details of which appeared in the Times - is understood to reflect Mr Neal's concern about the Home Office's oversight of compliance with the immigration rules by social care employers.

"8 December 2017","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament8 December 2017ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareHocAre the pro-EU Tory backbenchers going to be a threat to the EU bill? (to the right of the picture: Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan)Paper Tigers, or a lurking threat? There has been much talk of the possibility of an uprising of pro-EU Tory backbenchers threatening the government majority as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill inches through its committee stage, but as each flashpoint comes, and goes, they remain quiescent (apart from Ken Clarke, anyway). Now, with key issues due for debate on the scrutiny of Henry VIII powers and a bill to enact the final Brexit deal, might their moment have arrived? The first point to make is that the influence they have already exerted should not be under-estimated; the threat they pose has already pushed ministers into accepting that they need a full-dress piece of legislation to enact the final Brexit deal, which is a pretty major concession, and the government is now backing a Procedure Committee proposal for a scrutiny committee to oversee those sweeping Henry VIII powers. The context is that Tory MPs are deeply reluctant to take any step that could destabilise the government - and that their whips are doing their best to ensure they don't find themselves cornered into doing so. The other point is that - as the DUP so vividly demonstrated, this week - 10 government MPs would be enough to force their leadership into a mid-air reverse ferret, so there's safety in numbers. If enough of them jump together, government has to come to terms and would probably not dare impose a collective punishment, at least not immediately.  So the Tory dissidents' colleagues in the cross-party pro-EU alliance have to avoid expressing frustration, bite their lips and hope they will one day make their move.... but they're not holding their breath.Away from Brexit, there are important changes to the Data Protection Bill afoot in the Lords and there's plenty of interesting Westminster Hall action - watch out for the Labour MP Jess Phillips on funding for domestic violence refuges and Zac Goldsmith's animal welfare debate, which could presage the announcement of an incoming Animal Welfare Bill from Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:MondayThe Commons opens (2.30pm) with Education questions, with the probability of a major statement by the prime minister on the Brexit negotiations at 3.30pm. HocHow will shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer frame Labour's response?Watch the reaction from the different Brexit tribes very closely - do the Brexiteers see this as a win? Are the Tory mainstream rallying round to hail success, or not? Do the soft-Brexit/pro EU Tories sense an opportunity to keep Britain in the customs union? How warm, or chilly, is the DUP response? And where do Labour position themselves now? Will Sir Keir Starmer start laying down conditions for a trade deal, or will Labour seek to keep all tactical options open? That might postpone the second reading debate on the Finance Bill - the measure which enacts the Budget - for some hours. Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems have all offered up amendments to decline the bill a second reading, but there is also a backbench amendment spearheaded by Labour's Stella Creasy, which has attracted 73 signatures, including Vince Cable, the SNP's Angus Brendan MacNeil, Caroline Lucas, Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts and the Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon (there are, of course, no Conservative names - it would be pretty extraordinary for a government MP to oppose a Budget). This is the latest in a series of Budget amendments from this source, intended to highlight the lack of an independent gender impact assessment from the Office of Budget Responsibility, spelling out the consequences of the Budget measures for equality.Normally the Speaker automatically selects the official Opposition amendment - but the number of MPs behind this one might give him pause. Mr Bercow has stretched convention on issues like this before, and just might chance his arm and allow this one to be debated too. And whether or not it gets a formal vote, the issue is bound to feature in this debate, and ministers will need to offer some kind of answer.In Westminster Hall (4.30pm), there's a debate on  e-petition 200004: ""We, the undersigned, call upon HM Government to give the people of this country the final say on the Brexit deal negotiated by the UK and EU. This would be done through a referendum that would take place prior to the April 2019 exit date,"" which has attracted 136,159 signatures. The government has responded that ""it is clear that it is now its duty to implement the will of the people expressed in June 2016, and so there will be no second referendum"". The debate will cover a series of other e-petitions on the same issue.In the Lords (2.30pm), questions cover the possibility of UK citizens retaining their EU citizenship post-Brexit, the effectiveness of local welfare assistance schemes and why kinship carers who subsequently have their own child are not exempt from the two child limit - and finally Labour's Lord Soley has what seems to be a rather ironic offering on guidance for ministers in the Foreign Office concerning the diplomatic skills required for the performance of their duties. Expect titters.Any Brexit negotiation statement from the Commons will doubtless be repeated in the Lords at some point in the day, and then, peers will turn to the first report stage day on the  Data Protection Bill - where the key point will be an amendment from the crossbench peer, Baroness Kidron, which will require guidance to be issued to make websites used by children age-appropriate. This is the quid pro quo for allowing children aged 13 to agree terms and conditions on social media sites, and will include a requirement that those terms and conditions are comprehensible. A second issue is embodied by a Lab-Lib amendment to ensure the UK meets EU data protection standards after Brexit - this is essential in order to ensure data transfers are still permitted, after Britain leaves. The Commons opens (11.30am) with Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy questions.  The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill comes from Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts. Her Courts (Abuse of Process) Bill follows a survey of victims of stalking, harassment, domestic abuse and coercive behaviour which revealed that more than half faced vexatious court proceedings launched by people who had been convicted of abusing them. It meant that two-thirds of victims had to appear in court and one third were actually cross-examined by those who had already been convicted of attacking, stalking or engaging in a pattern of coercive control against them.This bill has cross-party support with the aim of prodding the Ministry of Justice to take action. Then MPs resume their yomp through the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill -  with day 6 of committee stage consideration, which will focus on Clause 7 of the bill, on dealing with deficiencies in retained EU law arising from withdrawal. The key issue here will be moves to create a sifting mechanism to allow MPs to monitor the use of the powers in the bill to reshape the law, so that it continues to work, post-Brexit.  This issue is targeted by a series of amendments from the former Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, to limit the powers given to ministers - but with new proposals on the way from the Commons Procedure Committee, and its Chair, Charles Walker, to create a sifting committee to flag up important issues and bring them before MPs, might he be satisfied with better scrutiny as opposed to writing restrictions into law?Watch out, too, for an amendment from the Conservative former children's minister, Tim Loughton, to guarantee child refugees the right to join family members in Britain, post-Brexit. Mr Loughton, a keen Brexiteer, wants to ensure that their rights under the EU's Dublin III agreement are retained. He probably won't push the issue to a vote, but will want to extract assurances from the government, and will then probably revisit it, when the forthcoming Immigration Bill appears.In Westminster Hall (9.30am) Labour's Jess Phillips leads a debate on funding for domestic violence refuges. She will be asking the government to rethink their proposals on removing housing benefit from women which she regards as well-intentioned but very naive. She fears they could halve the number of refuge spaces available. With the hints of an Animal Rights Bill being floated by the Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, his Conservative colleague Zac Goldsmith's debate on animal welfare will bear watching. He has a shopping list of measures he wants included, like a ban on trophies from endangered species, a ban on live exports, a ban on wild animals in circuses, restrictions on antibiotic use in farming, and new measures to clamp down on ivory trading. European Photopress AgencyAnother debate to catch my eye was Sir Henry Bellingham's, on the future of society lotteries, the Health Lottery and limits on prize values (at 2.30pm). He believes the current rules mean smaller lotteries are held back, because they are restricted to offering smaller prizes. In the Lords (2.30pm) question time covers the number of people diagnosed with atrial fibrilation who were admitted to hospital with a stroke in 2016-17, and were not on an appropriate anti-coagulation therapy, and the number of doctors from European Economic Area states working in the UK who may be planning to leave the NHS after Brexit.Then peers turn to the fourth day of committee stage debate on the detail of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill.  There will also be a short debate on human rights priorities in the light of Brexit - led by Labour's Lord Cashman.The Commons opens (11.30am) with Wales questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour MP Karen Buck would require householders to notify local authorities of an intention to register accommodation for short or holiday lets - she says councils are struggling to enforce the law on the maximum letting period of 90 days a year, with one hand tied behind their backs, and as the holiday let market soars, areas are losing permanent homes to the hospitality sector, while trying to manage all the issues arising from informal, quasi-hotels in residential communities. UK ParliamentFormer Attorney General Dominic Grieve has amendments down which, once again, could prove troublesome for the governmentHer bill would not ban short lets, but would help councils to enforce the law effectively.After that it's back to the detail of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill - focussing on Clause 9 on implementing the withdrawal agreement. The key issue here is the way the Commons processes the final deal; the government has agreed there should be a full-scale bill, allowing MPs to put down amendments, rather than a one-off vote, but once again Dominic Grieve and others have amendments down, and will need to be convinced that the government concession can be delivered if, for example, a final agreement is only reached at the last moment. This approval bill could be the arena for settling all kinds of disputes about the final form of Brexit. In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the parental rights of prisoners (9.30am); work capability assessments (2.30pm); male suicide (4pm) and quality in the built environment (4.30pm).My committee pick is the Joint Human Rights Committee hearing on Freedom of Speech in Universities (3.15pm) which pits witnesses who have been ""no-platformed"" on campuses against those who have banned them.  Peter Tatchell and Linda Bellos are among those appearing. In the Lords (3pm) questions cover such issues as a single national standard for household recycling and the number and percentage of students who will pay back their student loans in full.And then peers continue with the detail of the  Data Protection Bill. Watch out for a move to push for the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. The Commons opens (9.30 am) with Brexit questions, followed by the weekly update on forthcoming debates from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom. PAThe Waspi issue will once again come under scrutiny in the CommonsThen come two backbench debates - first another debate on equality of pension provision for women - the WASPI issue -  this time, on a motion calling for the government to publish proposals to provide a non-means tested bridging solution for all women born on or after 6 April 1950 who are affected by changes to the state pension age in the 1995 and 2011 Pension Acts.Then there is a debate on hormone pregnancy tests, led by the newly-knighted former minister, Sir Mike Penning. The motion regrets that the terms of reference for the Commission on Human Medicines Expert Working Group on hormone pregnancy tests  and believes the inquiry was flawed. It calls on the government to establish a statutory inquiry.In Westminster Hall (1.30pm), MPs debate the Home Affairs Committee Report on Asylum Accommodation, which warned of increasing pressure on the system and the urgent need to increase its capacity.  Then comes a debate (3pm) on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on government support for UK victims of IRA attacks that used Gaddafi-supplied Semtex and weapons, which calls for the government to do more to extract compensation from the government of Libya. This plays into a campaign across both Houses of Parliament (including a private members bill from the Ulster Unionist Peer Lord Empey) which is putting ministers under pressure.In the Lords (11am) questions to ministers cover impact of the Budget on north-east England , the revelations about tax avoidance in the Paradise Papers and the future of Disabled Students' Allowances.That is followed by a debate on the report by the Children's Commissioner for England 'On measuring the number of vulnerable children in England' and then a debate on the report of the Bach Commission 'The Right to Justice' - led by the eponymous Lord Bach, a former justice minister. He is looking for consensus around proposals for a 'Right to Justice Act' enshrining a statutory right to Access to Justice, and reform of the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act that he says damaged access to justice.The Commons is not sitting - in the Lords (10am) peers will hold second reading debates on three private members' bills, starting with the Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill, from the Lib Dem, Baroness Hamwee. This would allow leave to enter or remain in the UK to be granted to the family members of refugees and to refugees who are family members of British citizens and provide for legal aid to be available for refugee family reunion cases.Then comes the Immigration Control (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill from the Labour human rights barrister, Baroness Kennedy of The Shaws. This would allow the government to refuse entry to the UK, or to curtail leave to enter already granted, to a person who is a non-UK or non-EEA national who is known have been, involved in gross human rights abuses.Finally there is the Local Government Elections (Referendum) Bill from the Conservative, Lord Balfe. This should be lively, because the bill would permit a referendum to be held in any local government area, on introducing proportional representation voting for its local government elections.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-42280045"
"18 January 2022","Channel migrants: Armed forces set to take over English Channel operations","Channel migrants: Armed forces set to take over English Channel operations18 January 2022ShareAdam DurbinBBC NewsShareReutersThe armed forces are set to take charge of operations looking to limit migrant crossings in the English Channel. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the MoD had been commissioned as a ""crucial operational partner to protect our Channel against illegal migration"".  But Defence Select Committee chairman Tobias Ellwood criticised the plans as ""rushed"" and a ""massive distraction"" for the military.The move could begin within weeks, the BBC understands.Rear Admiral Mike Utley, the commander of the UK strike force, has been appointed to co-ordinate the plans. The number of people who crossed last year was treble that of 2020. On Saturday alone, 197 people were intercepted or rescued attempting to cross the English Channel, the Home Office said. French authorities stopped 95 people on five vessels from making the journey.Ministry of Defence (MoD) sources told the BBC discussions about the armed forces working with the Home Office and UK Border Force had been taking place for several weeks.They said no decisions had been made over how the Royal Navy or other services would be involved, and there was no indication it would involve pushing migrant boats back to France. That is despite Ms Patel suggesting in the House of Commons that the armed forces could be involved in the controversial policy, saying this was ""absolutely the policy of this government"". A source added the details of how the military could co-ordinate operations were still to be worked out, while another said there was ""trepidation"" within the MoD about getting involved in such a complex issue.It is understood overall policy on migration and migrant management would still be led by the Home Office. But the plans, first reported in the Times, could see Prime Minister Boris Johnson give the navy authority over government vessels in the channel.Channel migrants tragedy - Terrifying final hours of their fatal journeyFigures compiled by the BBC show at least 28,431 migrants made the journey in small boats in 2021 - up from 8,417 people the year before - despite huge UK investment in France to prevent crossings.On 24 November at least 27 people died after their boat sank, in the largest single loss of life in the Channel since records began in 2014. Ms Patel told MPs crossings were ""unfair, unacceptable and lethally dangerous"" as well as ""totally unnecessary"". She said France, and other EU member states, were ""safe countries with long-established asylum systems"". She added she had asked for ""naval MoD assets and support back in 2020"". ""No one department can resolve the complex issue of Channel crossings on their own,"" she added. Asked about the move on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it would help to avoid a situation where ""Border Force or other vessels in the Channel are being co-ordinated separately"".But Mr Ellwood, who is also a former veterans minister, described the proposals as being ""rushed out"". Speaking to Sky News, the Conservative MP said the plans were a ""massive distraction"" for the military amid growing threats from Russia and China, adding: ""This isn't what our navy should be doing.""For a prime minister who promised his Brexit deal would see the UK take back control of its borders, the failure to stop record numbers of asylum seekers arriving on the Kent coast in small boats is a political embarrassment.However, putting a rear admiral in charge of operations in the Channel is unlikely to make much difference. The Royal Navy may be able to provide better intelligence on where inflatables and dinghies are expected to make landfall, but the great majority of those coming to seek sanctuary in Britain are already intercepted before they reach the coast. Plans to push small boats back into French waters appear to have been deemed too dangerous and the often-trailed idea of processing migrants ""offshore"" in another country has so far failed to materialise. Migrant arrival facilities in Kent are currently being expanded.The reason for the increase in asylum seekers risking the perilous journey across the Channel is that Covid and improved security at Calais has effectively closed traditional points of entry. The government and refugee organisations agree the long-term solution is the creation of official safe routes for migrants fleeing conflict zones.  Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government had failed to do the serious and practical work with France needed to stop lives being lost and criminal gangs profiting from crossings.The Labour MP said the government had brought the navy in to patrol the Channel in 2019 but the two vessels used had intercepted no boats and had cost the government £780,000.""They need to explain what is different in these latest plans,"" she said.A government spokesperson said the public had had enough of people smugglers disregarding immigration laws and ministers were bringing in long-term changes. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said unacceptable numbers continued to cross and the government was exploring every avenue to stop them.Responding to the plans, CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon described them as ""cruel and inhumane"".""It's a desperate move by a government that isn't able to find solutions that will ensure an orderly, manageable and fair asylum system,"" he added.But Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said the news sent ""a clear message"" over how serious the government was about putting a stop to small boat crossings which were incredibly unsafe.In March last year, Ms Patel set out plans to overhaul the way people applying for asylum in the UK are treated.Under the proposals, people who arrive in the UK by what the government calls illegal means to claim asylum will no longer have the same entitlements as those who arrive through proper channels.The Labour Party has criticised the plans for lacking compassion and being ineffective at discouraging crossings.  Human rights lawyers warned they would be unlawful because they ignored Britain's international obligations.In December, four Iranian men who crossed in small boats had their convictions for immigration offences quashed by the Court of Appeal, which concluded it had not been proven they intended to enter the UK illegally.Three boats with 96 migrants cross the ChannelChannel migrant numbers trebled in 2021Migrants who piloted dinghies win court challengeMigrant tragedy is biggest loss of life in ChannelPatel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rulesBritish Armed ForcesEurope migrant crisis","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60021252"
"15 June 2018","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament15 June 2018ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareHouse of CommonsConservative MP Dominic Grieve (left) is one of the leading rebelsIt's back to Brexit again in both Houses of Parliament, after the issue of a ""meaningful vote"" unexpectedly detonated. Soft Brexit/Remainer Tory MPs, led by the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, thought they had a deal with the prime minister on the issue. They had drawn back from rebelling on Tuesday on the promise of a compromise - but then discovered that the government was not offering them what they thought had been conceded.Essentially the issue is about what happens if the divorce talks with the EU run out of time, or fail to deliver a deal, or if MPs reject the proposed deal. Here comes the science bit - concentrate!On Tuesday, MPs were presented with a Lords amendment that would have given the power to MPs to direct the government's next steps in those contingencies. The government offered a replacement amendment in the Commons (an ""amendment in lieu"" in parliamentary jargon) which gave MPs a vote on the final deal, but, crucially, did not give them the opportunity to direct the government's future strategy - what they would get instead would be a statement within 28 days, setting out how the government ""proposes to proceed in relation to negotiations for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU"".Dominic Grieve responded with his own amendment, which was similar to the Lords proposal, but put stronger conditions on MPs being given the power to direct the government. He set out three options which would only kick in three particular scenarios: Scenario A - MPs have voted against the withdrawal agreement - government must make a statement in the House of Commons within 28 days of MPs' vote outlining its approach. MPs must vote on what the government is proposing.Scenario B - No withdrawal agreement is reached by the end of November 2018 - MPs vote on a government motion setting out its proposed course of action.Scenario C - No withdrawal agreement is reached by 15 February 2019. Within 5 days, the government must bring it in front of MPs and follow any direction to negotiations that are voted on by MPs and debated by Lords.Having pulled back from rebellion he was expecting the government to concede most of these powers, but it was not to be - and now his Lords ally Lord Hailsham (the former cabinet minister Douglass Hogg) is to put forward his proposals in the Lords, with the aim of replacing the amendment the government won in the Commons, and kicking it back to MPs. The point is that Mr Grieve and his allies would then have a chance to press it to a vote - and quite possibly win.  Rebels: Brexit bill offer a slap in faceThe Tory psychodrama over Brexit billMinister quits government over BrexitBoth Houses have to agree on the final form of legislation before it can become law, and this intricate process - ""ping pong"" in Westminster-speak - is how MPs and peers reach an agreed wording. So on Monday we will have the Lords votes on the changes made by the Commons. Peers will probably accept most of them, but the Hailsham amendment looks set fair to be accepted (the previous version was passed by a majority of 91 votes) and it will then be kicked back to the Commons, for consideration on Wednesday.Will it win there? The government has a narrow majority with its DUP allies, but if the group around Mr Grieve vote with Labour and the other opposition parties, they would have a majority. Unless some Labour MPs broke ranks and voted with the government, or abstained. HocAnd there is a contingent of pro Brexit MPs and MPs from strongly Leave constituencies who may well do so. The arithmetic looks very tight, and the rival sets of party whips will doubtless be working very hard to minimise the number of rebels on their side. It's worth remembering that the Grieve group, unlike the Brexiteers, are not bloodied in rebellion from years of backbench insurgency - so it will be interesting to see if the iron has entered their souls, or whether they can be persuaded to relent. In the end it might even come down to MPs being taken ill or stuck on a train - but unless a new compromise is struck over the weekend, and the implication of bad faith around the previous deal may make that hard to do - we could be in for a week of drama which could prove highly destabilising to the government.Something else to watch out for is an effort to secure an Estimates Day debate on the Defence Budget; debates on these days are under a procedure which allows detailed discussion of money issues, and both the Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts Committee are extremely concerned about the state of the Ministry of Defence finances. As luck would have it, members of both were recently together at Rossyth, for a visit to the new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth II, and the rumour is that a coordinated move to get the issue onto the floor of the Commons has been cooked up. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:Monday 18 JuneThe Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Housing, Communities and Local Government questions - and any statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30 pm. Then comes the Emergency Debate secured by the SNP leader, Ian Blackford, on the Sewel Convention - the convention that Westminster seeks ""legislative consent"" for new laws touching on the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This follows the passage of amendments to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill on which EU powers will and will not be passed to the devolved parliaments, which were opposed by the Scottish Parliament. There was an errorThis content is not available in your location.SNP MPs walked out of the Commons in a row with the SpeakerAfter  last week's furious scenes, this could provide another flashpoint between the SNP and, in particular, the Scottish Tory MPs and the government whips - the whips have developed a habit of standing close to the SNP benches and heckling their MPs, which is much resented. MPs then deal with Lords amendments to the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill - in what should be a pretty brief encounter, before moving on to votes on a statutory instrument on the Draft European Union (Definition of Treaties) (Canada Trade Agreement) Order and European Documents relating to EU Trade Agreements: EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement. And after that there is a general debate on how the NHS and other public services deal with acquired brain injuries.In Westminster Hall (4.30 pm) MPs debate e-petition 209433: ""Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords - the House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people."" The petition attracted 168,755 signatures.My committee pick is the Transport Committee hearing (4.45pm) on Rail timetable changes - when MPs will question top executives from GTR, Arriva Rail North, London North Western and Network Rail. It was announced on Friday that Charles Horton is to resign as chief executive of Govia Thameslink Railway, following months of controversy over delays and cancellations to services. Bring popcorn. In the Lords, after a half hour question time at 2.30pm, peers embark on their consideration of Commons amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill  (see above).MPs kick off (at 11.30 am) with Health and Social Care questions, after which the Conservative Craig Mackinlay presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill to give Gibraltar an MP (this had been due to be debated some months ago, and was rescheduled). Then comes a Labour Opposition Day Debate on a motion (or motions) to be announced.In Westminster Hall, the opening debate (9.30am) is on Romania: the member state which will hold the EU Presidency next year, and therefore has a crucial brokering role in the final Brexit negotiations. The debate will be opened by the Conservative, Bob Blackman, who believes Romania is very keen to help, and will want to extend bilateral arrangements with the UK, post Brexit. He also wants to discuss Romanian concerns about Russian activity in the Black Sea.Labour's Helen Goodman (2.30pm) leads a debate on geothermal energy, which she says has a huge potential to provide a carbon free energy source - including in former coal communities, where decommissioned mine shafts can be used. But, she says, it does not feature in the government's energy strategy. Her aim in this debate is to raise the profile and press ministers to take the opportunities seriously.AFPPalestinians attend morning prayers during the first day of the celebrations of Eid al-Fitr, at the Israel-Gaza borderMy committee corridor pick is the International Development hearing (10am) on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, with witnesses from the UN, followed by the Foreign Office and International Development and minister, Alistair Burt.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers debate the detail of the Rating (Property in Common Occupation) and Council Tax (Empty Dwellings) Bill - the measure that will allow local councils to increase the tax on empty homes. Then there is a short debate on encouraging a recovery in the population of bees and other pollinators.The Commons begins (11.30am) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions, before moving on to the high noon of Prime Minister's Question time.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from the SNP's Martin Docherty-Hughes aims to create an Armed Forces Representative Body. Time has then been set aside to consider Lords amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill (see above) and there will be a general debate on Nato.Last week's PMQs was high in drama...One thing to keep an eye on is a possible statement from a health minister on the findings of Bishop James Jones' independent inquiry into deaths at the Gosport Memorial Hospital. The inquiry was commissioned during the coalition years, following concerns about the over-use of morphine on patients. Look out for Lib Dem former health minister Norman Lamb...In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the UN report on the convention on the rights of persons with disabilities (9.30am-11am);  the UK constitutional machinery and the frameworks for intergovernmental cooperation (2.30pm-4pm); UK and Polish war reparations against Germany (4pm-4.30pm) and insecure work and the gig economy (4.30pm-5.30pm). On the committee corridor, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee (9.30am) takes evidence one year on, on local authority support for Grenfell Tower survivors - there are witnesses from Grenfell United, the North Kensington Law Centre, Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, the Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, and Nick Hurd, the minister of state for Policing and Fire Service, with responsibility for Grenfell Tower victims work, at the Home Office. And meanwhile, there's a lively session in prospect, when arch europhile MEP Guy ""the Hoff"" Verhofstadt, the coordinator and chair of the European Parliament Brexit Steering Group, gives evidence to the Brexit Committee on the progress of the UK's negotiations on EU withdrawal (9.15 am) - and he turns up again in the afternoon, before the Home Affairs Committee (2.30pm) to talk about Post-Brexit migration policy. The European Parliament has to sign off on the EU side of Britain's divorce deal, so his views will matter.In the Lords (3pm), the main event is the second reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Bill, which seeks to remove restrictions on how judges can be deployed, so they can hear a wider range of cases.

He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group.For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose.He cites events and opinions in the country as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package.While most Americans probably haven't heard of Britain First and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely.

"4 March 2022","What's happening in Parliament next week?","What's happening in Parliament next week?4 March 2022ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareReutersEvents in Ukraine seem sure to dominate the parliamentary week, starting on Monday, when the Commons is expected to vote through all stages of the Economic Crime Bill in a single sitting.And there will also be a stream of government statements and urgent questions as events unfold - and votes on orders for additional sanctions and other measures might well be added to the schedule.The long-promised bill enacts one of the major aims of campaigners against money laundering - creating a register that will mean foreign owners of UK property must declare and verify their identity with Companies House.The aim is to stop overseas criminals and oligarchs using agents to create companies which then buy up property in the UK, preserving their anonymity. But, even within the constraints of a tight timetable, expect considerable probing from some of the formidable alliance of backbench campaigners which brings together MPs who have been campaigning on Russia, on anti-corruption measures and on banking reform - people like Dame Margaret Hodge, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Kevin Hollinrake, Chris Bryant, Layla Moran.'Worrying loopholes'They have long pressed for tougher action against oligarchs who launder their illicit billions through the ""London Laundromat"" of property transactions and anonymous companies. There are already a number of amendments down from these quarters.There will only be three votes allowed on amendments during this fast-track process. Opposition parties are cooperating to rush the bill through, so any pressure will mostly take the form of awkward questions and demands for assurances from ministers, and there are attempts to coordinate amendments against what Dame Margaret called ""worrying loopholes in the bill"".Alongside the debates in the chamber, the Treasury Committee will be looking at the effectiveness of Russian economic sanctions, the impact on Russia and the UK, and the role of the Economic Crime Bill in sanctioning oligarchs. The bill then moves rapidly to the Lords for a second Reading debate on Wednesday, followed by Committee, Report and Third Reading, probably on Monday 14 March (among other things, this pushes back to last Report Stage day on the Health and Care Bill, which was due to contain some of the most important action, to Wednesday 16 March).All of this means the traffic jam of major legislation inching its way through the Lords seems to be getting worse.EPAThe treatment of Ukrainian refugees is likely to be debatedThis week saw significant government defeats on the detail of the Health and Care Bill (Baroness Cumberlege's important amendment on the issue of NHS workforce planning), while whole chunks of the Nationality and Borders Bill have been unceremoniously deleted by peers.That will mean epic bouts of ""ping-pong"" as the Commons and Lords seek to finalise these two very important bills.And, factoring in the Easter holiday, there are not many legislating days left before the expected late-April prorogation of Parliament - a problem only exacerbated by the late addition of the Economic Crime Bill to the workload.Expect plenty of sittings to extend into the small hours.Turnout concernsThe regularity with which the government is losing Lords votes on major bills is getting a bit embarrassing. ""It's like shooting fish in a barrel,"" one opposition peer told me.A key factor is that the Tory troops are just not turning out. At one point this week the government was being defeated by little more than 80 opposition peers (the combined forces of Labour, crossbenches and Lib Dems, plus the occasional Conservative rebel and the odd bishop).The point here is when the government vote is down to 70 or so it means two-thirds of Conservative peers are not backing ministers in important votes.That's a real problem, especially when it means MPs are repeatedly being marched through the Commons lobbies to reverse Lords defeats on sensitive issues.This will include a number of issues around the treatment of refugees, just at the moment the Ukraine refugee crisis is hitting.The question is whether ministers will offer concessions to get their legislation through? Or will they try to face down rebellious peers?With the government keen to hold a State Opening, to launch a new legislative programme, and being a post-pandemic political reset, there seems to be some urgency to complete the current batch of legislation and move on. UK PARLIAMENTEx-cabinet minister Maria Miller will lead a debate on women's rightsCommittee action includes Foreign Secretary Liz Truss before Foreign Affairs on Monday, after her session last week was postponed, much to the irritation of the committee.Meanwhile, Home Affairs is unhappy that Immigration Minister Kevin Foster has declined an invitation to give evidence on Ukraine refugee crisis. It has asked him to reconsider.Watch out, too, for the annual International Women's Day debate on Thursday, led by former cabinet minister Maria Miller. She will be focussing on the importance of democracy in protecting women's rights and on the impact of the Ukraine crisis on women.

"6 January 2018","The week ahead in Parliament","The week ahead in Parliament6 January 2018ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareReutersWhile the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is briefly in hibernation, the accumulation of amendments before its Report Stage consideration will bear watching. Within hours of the end of committee consideration, a respectable number had appeared, mostly from the parties or the usual suspects - including Labour's Chris Leslie and the Conservative Dominic Grieve. Hard core parliamentary and Brexit nerds should keep an eye out for the supplementary programme motion setting out the timings and how the Report Stage debate will be divided up into subject headings - I'm assuming there will be sections on devolution issues, ministerial powers and ""anything else"". But the absence of that Bill will not mean there is no Brexit legislation for MPs to chew on in the week ahead; The Taxation (Cross-Border) Trade Bill on Monday and the Trade Bill (Tuesday) are both important building blocks for post Brexit Britain - and they have the same generic issue as the Withdrawal Bill, which is that because they are designed to implement agreements that have not yet been reached, they contain very sweeping and general powers.Brexit bills to dominate parliament in 2018So expect more talk about Henry VIII, and the importance of parliamentary scrutiny - as well as a fair measure of cooperation by ""soft Brexit"" backbenchers across parties. It's all process, so the biggest Brexit story event may well be whatever discussion there is of Michael Gove's proposals to reform farm subsidies, after Britain leaves the Common Agricultural Policy; it's hard to imagine that a public policy announcement of this magnitude not leading to a statement in the House, or at least an Urgent Question.Watch out, too, for the next moves by a series of select committees on issues of concern to them. The powerful alliance of committee chairs concerned about the funding of the NHS may swing into action, and if Labour are at all on the ball, they will be seeking an Education Committee confirmation hearing for Toby Young, after his controversial appointment to the board of the new university watchdog, the Office for Students. Watch out for the Environmental Audit Committee Chair Mary Creagh's follow-up to its proposals for a 25p ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups. Already she has written to the Speaker to suggest Parliament should set an example by cutting the 650,000 disposable cups it uses each year. All of next week's action takes place in the shadow of a government reshuffle, which might, or might not, be manifest by Friday. The result could be some interesting dispatch box moments with some new arrivals fielding questions with minimal briefing and some ministers who are facing the chop having to cope with jibes from the Opposition or - probably equally unwelcome - expressions of sympathy. That's all assuming the prime minister doesn't conclude that a reshuffle is more trouble than it's worth. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:Monday 8 JanuaryPAThe 70th anniversary of the Windrush generation will be markedThe Commons launches into 2018 with Home Office Questions at 14.30 GMT, doubtless to be followed with any number of post-holiday Urgent Questions and Ministerial Statements.These could cover everything from the strain on the NHS in England to the situation in Iran, to those Michael Gove plans for post Brexit farm subsidies, to the possible selling off of the Navy's assault ship, HMS Ocean (which of Plymouth MPs Johnny Mercer (C) and Luke Pollard (Lab) will get there first, I wonder?).After these, MPs will move on the Second Reading of the Taxation (Cross-Border) Trade Bill, which will allow ministers to set up a post-Brexit customs system, to ensure that goods can move smoothly and safely in and out of the UK, and allow the UK to set and collect its own duty on goods coming into the country. The powers will have to be fairly broad, because the structures they will set up will depend on the outcome of the EU negotiations.Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have amendments down to deny the Bill a Second Reading; Labour point to a lack of a coherent plan for customs and tariffs post-Brexit, the SNP cite the Irish border issue and the Lib Dems reject the Bill because it assumes the UK will leave the EU Customs Union. My Committee pick is the Communities and Local Government hearing on private rented housing, where the key issue is whether councils have sufficient powers to tackle rogue landlords. The committee is also using the session with academics and the homelessness charity, Shelter, for its pre-legislative scrutiny of the Government's draft Tenants Fees Bill, which would ban the imposition of letting fees on tenants.In the Lords, beginning at 14.30 GMT, questions to ministers include the former Chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee, Lord Spicer, asking about reporting to Parliament on Brexit; Lib Dem Baroness Floella Benjamin asks about commemorating the 70th anniversary of the arrival of the MV Empire Windrush carrying Caribbean people who had been encouraged to emigrate to the UK by the Government.The Green Party peer Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb will raise the establishment of an independent environmental enforcement agency before the UK leaves the EU, and the Lib Dem Lord Roberts of Llandudno will raise the arrangements for child refugees post-Brexit.The main debate is on the Government's Industrial Strategy and the case for boosting earning power and productivity across the UK with investment in the skills, businesses and infrastructure of the future.Tuesday 9 January:AFPConservative MP Tim Loughton will speak up on behalf of the families of victims of the Shoreham air crashThe Commons opens, at 11.30 GMT, with Foreign Office Questions - followed, in all probability by more Ministerial Statements and Urgent Questions.Then comes a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative Peter Aldous on Construction (Retention Deposit Schemes). He has a draft bill dealing with the issue of building contractors (including some local authorities) sitting on money owing to their sub-contractors, sometimes till they go bust. Various attempts to put voluntary arrangements in place have failed to bring an improvement.The main legislating is on the Second Reading of the Trade Bill - which, taken together with Monday's Customs Bill - will give ministers the power to set a new post-Brexit trade policy so that the UK has a new system in place on the first day after Brexit.The powers include allowing transition trade agreements that currently exist between the EU and other countries, and which Britain is party to through the EU; establishing the UK as a member of the Government Procurement Agreement, a key international arrangement which gives access to £1.3 trillion worth of government contracts and procurement opportunities in 47 countries; creating a new independent UK body, the Trade Remedies Authority, to defend UK businesses against unfair trade practices, and to ensure the Government has powers to gather and share trade information.Once again, Labour, and the SNP have amendments down to deny it a Second Reading. Labour's is rather interestingly-worded, noting that Britain will need a new legal framework for post-Brexit trade agreements ""whether or not the UK concludes a new long-term customs union with the EU."" This does not amount to staying in the existing CU, since the amendment goes on to talk about new trade deals that would not be possible if we did, but all the same it zeros in on a key issue. And there is also reference to the lack of proper parliamentary procedures to scrutinise what will be very important trade treaties. The SNP amendment explicitly says the bill should be blocked because it rules out remaining in the EU Single Market or the CU, with no assessment of the impact of that policy.In Westminster Hall the opening debate. from 9.30 to 11.00 GMT, is on the effect of universal credit on the private rented sector. It will be led by the Lib Dem Work and Pensions shadow, Stephen Lloyd, who has spoken in the Commons about his concerns that the 1.5 million private sector rented tenants on Housing Benefit across the UK could, unless the government make it easy for landlords to receive direct payments from tenants on Universal Credit, be in danger of losing their homes if they fall behind with their payments. He says private landlords can't afford not to receive rents for months on end, as councils and housing associations sometimes can, in emergency situations.That is followed by a debate on Luton airport expansion at 11 GMT. The Conservative Bim Afolami says there is great concern from Hertfordshire residents about the proposed huge expansion of the airport. He plans to use this debate to address issues like infrastructure - there isn't much in a rural area, he says, and noise pollution which he says is high even with the current 16 million passengers using the airport. With a government decision on Heathrow and other airport expansion expected at some point this year, this is the first in a number of debates on the issues around expanding various airports. In the afternoon, the Labour MP Ian C. Lucas leads a debate on changes to the Independent Living Fund. This will focus on concerns about the Welsh Government's proposal to transfer administration of the Independent Living Fund for disabled people to local authorities.At 16.00 GMT, local MP Tim Loughton has another in the series of debates he has led on different aspects of the Shoreham air show crash. This one will centre on access to justice for families of the victims - the specific issue is families of victims not qualifying for exceptional circumstances legal aid at the Coroner's Inquest, and the broader point of family access to justice on equal terms in disasters like Shoreham or Hillsborough.The Labour MP Dan Jarvis's Yorkshire devolution debate, at 16.30 GMT, picks up on the outcome of a referendum in South Yorkshire on proposals to create a Sheffield City Region authority, covering Barnsley Doncaster, and Rotherham - and perhaps ultimately extending into Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire. This has been the subject of considerable controversy, with many Yorkshire MPs and councils arguing for an all-Yorkshire super council instead. This would be a very large authority indeed - with a population greater than Scotland and twice that of Wales. Mr Jarvis says the referendum result (85% in favour of the All Yorkshire option in Doncaster and Barnsley) give him and his allies the mandate to tell ministers that the Sheffield plan does not have support and push them towards the all-Yorkshire alternative. Helpfully the Business Secretary Greg Clark - who was in charge of devolution in England in his previous incarnation as Communities Secretary - has argued that devolved authorities should not be imposed from the top down.My Committee picks are the Science and Technology hearing (at 9.30 GMT) on e-cigarettes - this is the traditional inquiry opener with experts and academics, and will focus on their relative harmfulness and the health effects on users. The meeting will also explore the role of e-cigarettes for people giving up smoking. I expect rather harder-edged politics in the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee hearing (10.00 GMT) on what would happen if the current Parliamentary Boundary Review is ditched. The review, due to be completed in October, aims to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600 as well as equalising the size of constituencies. But a Labour private members bill - which might well command a Commons majority - could order a new review based on keeping 650 MPs. The Committee will hear from the Secretaries of all four Boundary Commissions (for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) as well as from elections experts Professor Jane Green, Professor Ron Johnston, and Professor Roger Scully. In the Lords, (at 14.30 GMT), the main debates are on the second readings of two relatively uncontroversial government bills; Firstly, the Secure Tenancies (Victims of Domestic Abuse) Bill -- this delivers the Conservative manifesto commitment to ensure that those who have a lifetime tenancy and flee domestic violence are able to secure a new lifetime tenancy automatically. Second is the Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill - which will allow people who target transport operators with laser devices to be jailed for up to five years and removes the £2,500 cap on the fine offenders can face. The Bill provides specific protection for drivers of trains and buses, captains of boats and pilots of hovercraft, and will make it easier to prosecute offenders by removing the need to prove an intention to endanger a vehicle.Wednesday 10 JanuaryMental health support in prisons will be highlighted by Labour's Harriet HarmanThe Commons opens, at 11.30 GMT, with half an hour of questions to the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.On previous occasions the now resigned First Secretary of State, Damian Green, led for the government; it is not clear whether he will be replaced, or whether the prime minister will scrap the post of First Secretary altogether. The Chancellor of the Duchy is the Conservative Party Chairman Patrick McLoughlin, also widely tipped for the sack - so there may be more than the usual level of interest in an occasion that is generally treated as an appetiser for PMQs - which will follow at noon.The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill is proposed by Labour's John Spellar, who goes in to bat for the live music scene with a bill to provide planning protection for its venues; where new housing is built nearby, he wants to establish that if there are concerns about noise from the venue, the new arrival should be required to stump up for any insulation or other mitigation measures. He says there has been some sympathy from ministers, but that a clear change in the law is needed, rather than a change in guidelines.The day's main debate will be on a Labour motion, on a subject to be announced. In Westminster Hall the day opens, at 9.30 GMT, with a debate on mental health in prisons.Harriet Harman, the chair of Parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights, will highlight their recent inquiry, which found that a human rights-based approach can lead to better prevention of deaths in prison of people with mental health conditions. Other subjects for debates include the Disability Confident scheme (14.30 GMT) and patient travel times for cancer treatment (16.00 GMT) - a subject raised by the former Lib Dem Leader, Tim Farron, in the last PMQs of 2017. He was concerned that when patients had to travel a long distance for treatment, it had a massive impact on the outcome. Finally (at 16.30 GMT) there's another airport-related debate on growth and noise mitigation at Gatwick Airport, led by the Conservative Tom Tugendhat. My committee pick is the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee hearing on the government's energy price cap bill, which is aimed at protecting vulnerable customers by lowering fuel costs. The witnesses are Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan and a government minister.In the Lords, at 15.00 GMT, the main event is the final Report Stage debate on the Data Protection Bill -  where the key issues will be data controllers, the Information Commissioner, a data ethics advisory board., class action on breaches, and a Leveson 2 inquiry. There is talk of a possible government concession on Baroness Hollins' amendment on Leveson 2 - the second phase of the Inquiry set up by David Cameron, into press ethics. If the concession doesn't appear, the issue may be forced to a vote and that might mean a government defeat.The dinner break business is a regret motion from the Labour Peer, George Foulkes, on the transport policing aspects of the Scotland Act (Consequential Functions) Order.Thursday 11 JanuaryTory MPs could use a Labour debate to warn about defence cutsMPs open, at 9.30 GMT, with International Trade Questions, followed at 10.00 GMT by Women and Equalities Questions, and then the Commons Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.The main debate is on a backbench motion on defence from the Labour former Shadow Defence Secretary, Vernon Coaker. It calls for UK defence spending and service manpower to be maintained at at least current levels, without the loss of any significant military capabilities. It has been quite a while since the last full-scale Commons debate on defence and the occasion should provide a rallying point for MPs concerned about the erosion of the armed forces - and in particular for increasingly vocal backbenchers like Jonny Mercer, who are openly threatening rebellion.This replaces the planned debate on the Restoration and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster - the multi billion pound scheme to restore Parliament's iconic Victorian home; this has been postponed because many MPs did not want it held on a Thursday, and a new, prime-time debating slot is being sought.... the latest delay in actually holding a debate that has been promised since September 2016.In Westminster Hall (1.30 pm) there's a debate on a report from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, wittily entitled Forestry in England: Seeing the wood for the trees.In the Lords, at 11.00 GMT, questions cover the UK's withdrawal from the London Fisheries Convention, additional funding to the NHS to prepare for winter, the import of poorer quality food produced to lower animal welfare standards from the US.Then there's a topical short debate led by the Lib Dem, Tony Greaves, asking what the government is doing about the Chinese ban on imports of plastic and other waste - vast quantities of UK waste had been shipped to China, so the move has huge implications for waste recycling in Britain.Then it's on to debates on subjects chosen by Crossbench peers; they should enjoy these while they have the chance - with the Brexit legislative load about to increase, future Thursdays are likely to be devoted to legislation, although it will tend to be the less controversial bills, where Committee Stage has been taken in Grand Committee. First the social housing expert Lord Best leads a debate on the performance of the UK's major housebuilders, then the film director and children's rights campaigner Baroness Kidron has a debate on the role played by social media and online platforms as news and content publishers.Neither House sits on Friday.Brexit bills to dominate parliament in 2018","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42582456"

"20 November 2017","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament20 November 2017ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareAFPFor a week or so, even Brexit is eclipsed by the Budget. It is a moment of huge pressure on the Chancellor - and not just for the usual economic reasons - because the Tory troops will be looking for a financial package that injects new vigour and purpose into the government after a dangerously shaky interlude. The question is whether Philip Hammond can deliver without losing control of government borrowing. Remember that a number of recent budgets have run into real parliamentary trouble - remember George Osborne's Omnishambles Budget, the Pasty Tax, the Tax Credits fiasco, or Mr Hammond's travails over NICs? The government's general weakness and the targeting of the Chancellor by his political rivals have created an environment in which any measure in his Budget could suddenly become a serious vulnerability.It doesn't look like there will be major votes on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill (see below) but keep an eye out for government concessions over issues due to surface later in the debate, like their proposed amendment to specify the precise date and time of Brexit.Away from the chamber, watch out for the publication by the Work and Pensions and BEIS committees of a bill to go with their latest report ""A framework for modern employment"" on the gig economy and the need to sort out the law on self-employment. 'm told its proposals will be very strong and worker-friendly and were agreed without dissent by the two committees. The two chairs, Rachel Reeves and Frank Field, have been lobbying for legislation and have asked the prime minister for parliamentary time to introduce their own bill, if the government is too busy with other matters.Here's my rundown of the Westminster week ahead:MondayThe Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Home Office questions - and after an hour of those, expect the usual post weekend crop of ministerial statements and urgent questions. The main event is a Ways and Means Resolution for the Taxation (Cross-Border) Trade Bill, which is intended to  allow the UK to operate a standalone customs, VAT and excise system after Brexit. This is a lot more interesting than it sounds. Ways and Means Resolutions are the device by which Parliament authorises taxes - in a budget the Chairman of Ways and Means, currently Lindsay Hoyle is presented with an envelope of these resolutions, which are put to the House - some almost immediately, to authorise rises in alcohol and tobacco duties, for example. The resolutions set out the tax changes the government proposes, and in this case the government is tooling up to make what could quite possibly be major changes to VAT and other duties on Brexit Day. A key point is how this will apply across the Irish border. The government has said it hopes to avoid physical border, but agreement has yet been reached with the EU about how this can be achieved. Expect a bit of DUP probing in this debate.ReutersAgreement has yet been reached with the EU about the borderAt the moment, of course, VAT is largely shaped by Brussels, but this measure could equip ministers to change the pattern of the tax, and zero rate things that cannot be zero-rated at the moment... they might (and this is me speculating) vary, or remove altogether, the current 5% rate on domestic fuel. And similarly the bill will also allow the government to set tariffs for cross-border trade, which could be very significant, in the absence of trade deals with particular countries, or with the EU.The adjournment debate, led by the former Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan, now chair of the Treasury Committee, is on Companies House and transgender persons - this is part of her longstanding campaign to ensure that documentation of companies does not ""out"" transgendered people against their will. In March, she presented a private member's bill to give transgender persons the right to demand that Companies House withhold their personal information from the public record, preventing details about a director's former name being disclosed, if the individual's transition and personal would be revealed to people searching the Register of Directors.  In Westminster Hall (4.30pm) there is a debate on two e-petitions on the TV Licence fee. The first, e-petition 170931, says: ""I believe the TV licence should be abolished, removed and not a legal requirement. It should be included through your provider for free. TV is expensive enough without the added extra worry of £130+ a year."" It was signed by 125,958 people. The second e-petition 200239 says: ""The TV Licence is no longer fit for purpose and should be abolished. It is unfair that one should hold one to watch Freeview channels or indeed subscription TV. The BBC should look at alternative methods of funding particularly as it is commonly felt there is a high level of bias."" This received 12,762 signatures.In the Lords (2.30 pm) the first business is the introduction of a new peer - Lord Burnett of Maldon, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.Question time covers the impact on tourism of the UK's leaving the EU Open Skies Agreement, whether prefab housing could help fix the housing market, VAT evasion by overseas sellers trading online in the UK, and the number of company start-ups in 2016. Then peers return to the detail of the Data Protection Bill in their fifth committee stage day - they will be debating Clauses 112-148 which deal with the role of the Information Commissioner and enforcement powers. There will also be a short debate on the operation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the devolved administrations - led by the UUP's Lord Empey.The Commons opens (11.30am) with Foreign Office questions, after which (assuming no statements or urgent questions) the Conservative, Huw Merriman, a member of the Transport Select Committee, presents a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Automatic Travel Compensation - this would deliver automated delay-repay compensation for flights, rail journeys and other forms of transport. Then MPs move on the third committee stage day of debate on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. While there are several Dominic Grieve amendments down for debate, and they have been signed by enough Conservative MPs to look threatening to the government, I'm not sure they will be pushed to a vote. HocThis section of committee stage centres around the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and there are a variety of amendments intended to make sure that the rights it sets out are not lost, post Brexit. But at this stage, the Tory backbenchers, in a rather House of Lords-like way, want to hear a response from the government (in the form of Solicitor General Robert Buckland) rather than stage a rebellion; if they're not happy, they might have a go when the debate reaches report stage. If they do force a vote, it would mark a real escalation in hostilities with their own leadership. In Westminster Hall, the debates range across UK amphibious capability in the 21st century (9.30am-11am) and the state pension age (4.30pm-5.30pm).My eye was caught by a Brexit-related debate on the future of medicines regulation (2.30pm-4pm). This is led by Labour's Helen Goodman, who says life sciences and pharmaceuticals employ thousands of people, spend millions on R&D and generate a £3bn trade surplus for the UK.  But she is concerned about the future regulation of medicines, because it is not clear if the UK will stay in the European Medicines Agency. My committee pick (9.30am) is the Home Affairs hearing on post-Brexit immigration services with Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis. The focus will be on arrangements for an increased workload, post-Brexit. In the Lords, business begins (2.30 pm) with the introduction of another new peer. But in this case it's a familiar figure, Lord Chartres - the former Bishop of London, Richard Chartres - who was on the Bishops' Benches for 20 years. His main areas of interest were climate change, heritage and historic buildings, and Russia (he's an expert on the Russian Orthodox Church and has many links).After that, question time covers the possibility of legislation to control the use of drones, human rights in Indian-held Kashmir, and the target number for additional social homes to be built by 2022.   The third reading of the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill is not quite the usual rubber-stamping exercise: a government amendment promised on a ""breathing space"" for people in financial difficulty. Labour peers were asked to be on stand-by in case a vote was held. That is followed by the first day of detailed committee stage scrutiny of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill. Peers will be focusing on Clauses 1-40, which deal with such matters as sanctions regulation and court reviews - and the debate may be rather spiced up by the latest report from the Lords Constitution Committee which has warned that the bill contains ""inappropriately broad powers for ministers"". The committee's verdicts are taken extremely seriously by peers, and can swing support behind amendments if ministers fail to take their recommendations on board. In the Commons (11.30am) it's question time for the ministers in the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - before the weekly delights of Prime Minister's Question Time, at noon. But the main event will be the Budget delivered by the Chancellor, Philip Hammond. One nuance to watch out for is a possible nod to the Scottish Tories - with the announcement of some goodies for Scotland, prompted by their lobbying, and quite possibly not routed through the SNP government in Holyrood.PSNIA seizure of 'skunk' cannabisIn Westminster Hall, the debate on the roll-out of broadband to rural communities in Scotland has important devolution overtones - although it is a national policy issue, implementation is passed to local authorities in England and the Scottish government in Scotland, and Scottish Conservative John Lamont wants to make what he says is slow progress to providing an essential service an issue about the competence of the SNP administration(9.30am-11am). Another debate to catch my eye was the Conservative Craig Mackinlay's on the human and financial costs of drug addiction (2.30pm-4pm). He chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Cannabis: Harmful effects on developing brains, and he wants to put on public record the costs, human and financial of drug addiction in the UK. ""The effects of Skunk cannabis on youngsters is increasingly being recognised as is the additional human cost - a significant rise in traffic related deaths in Colorado following decriminalisation."" He also wants to highlight the record the level of Opioid deaths in the United States - 65,000 in 2016.On the committee corridor, look out for the Work and Pensions hearing (9.30 am) on medical assessments for disability benefits. The contractors, ATOS, Capita and Maximus, have been criticised for their handling of PIP and ESA assessments - both on the treatment of claimants and on the verdicts they have reached on fitness for work. There has been a huge response to the committee's call for evidence and today MPs will hear the experiences of five claimants, and  take evidence from welfare advisers from a series of advice groups.In the Lords (3pm) question time covers planning for delay-free border crossings between the UK and EU after Brexit, the Social Mobility Commission's 'State of the Nation' report and collection of recycled materials. Then peers return to the detail of the Data Protection Bill - focusing on clauses 149-179 which cover Enforcement, Supplementary and Final Provisions.There will also be a short debate on improving the standard of wound care in the NHS - led by Labour's Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. The Commons meets at 9.30am for half an hour of International Trade questions, followed by half an hour of Women and Equalities questions. There will also be the weekly statement on forthcoming Commons business. And then MPs will move on to the next phase of the Budget debate - the themes for each day of the Budget debate are announced on Budget day. The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Iain Stewart, is on the 1979 same roof rule for familial sexual abuse cases. This is part of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. Campaigners say it treats those victims who were abused before 1 October 1979 less favourably than those who were subjected to abuse after that date. This is the point at which the rules were changed to allow for awards involving intra-family violence. Before that, compensation awards were not possible where the victim and offender were living together as members of the same family.ReutersSadiq Khan will be questioned about attempts to improve London's air qualityThe hot new committee corridor trend for joint working will see the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, Health, Transport and Environmental Audit committees join forces for an inquiry into air quality (9.45pm). Their first hearing will host witnesses from the environmental law firm, ClientEarth, the Medical Research Council, and the European Environment Agency, culminating in an appearance by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. In the Lords (11am), questions to ministers cover devolution post Brexit, alcohol abuse in England and the long-term needs of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh - that last is from the former International Development minister Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, a recent visitor to the refugee camps. The main debates are on subjects chosen by Labour backbenchers, starting with maintaining UK defence forces at a sufficient level to contribute to global peace, stability and security - led by Lord Soley. This has attracted a pretty decent speakers list - including such luminaries as Lord Boyce (former Admiral of the Fleet, Chief of the Defence Staff and First Sea Lord); Lord Craig of Radley (Air Marshal  and former Chief of the Defence Staff); the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Owen, and Labour's sea-going peer, Lord West of Spithead.The second debate is on the challenges facing problem gamblers, online gambling and the Multi-Operator Self Exclusion Scheme and the third on reviewing section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. The Commons is not sitting, but in the Lords, peers will be debating private members bills, starting (10am) with  Equality Act 2010 (Amendment) (Disabled Access) Bill from Lord Blencathra.This is a bill to amend the Equality Act 2010 to improve access to public buildings by introducing six-inch and 12-inch rules for step-free access. Speakers already include several members of the Lords ""disability bench,"" including Baroness Masham, Baroness Thomas of Winchester and Baroness Brinton.Then comes the second reading of the Home Education (Duty of Local Authorities) Bill from the Labour peer, Lord Soley. This will require local councils to monitor the educational, physical and emotional development of children receiving elective home education.Lord Soley argues that many parents take their child or children out of school for home education because they feel that the school is not giving their child the education that they think is necessary - including parents who have had a bad experience of the special needs service. But he is concerned that, in the process, some children do not get the basic education necessary to cope in the modern world. He is also worried that abusive parents are now more aware of scrutiny, and home education can allow them to 'hide' the child. Third is the second reading of the homelessness campaigner Lord Bird's Creditworthiness Assessment Bill - assessing people's ability to pay a mortgage take into account rental payment history and council tax payment history.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-42047348"

Government sources say it is a mature approach that maintains a commitment to taking on big, difficult and complex challenges; not just Brexit but reform of social care, too, for instance.Labour says Mrs May's speech proves the Conservatives have ""completely run out of ideas"" and were reduced to ""begging"" for policy proposals from them.But Mrs May insisted the government had ""an ambitious agenda to change this country"", adding that there were many issues on which she  ""would hope we would be able to achieve consensus across this House"", such as police and security agencies having the powers they need to deal with the terrorist threats they face.The exchanges came ahead of Mrs May's speech which will return to the message from her first day in Downing street last July, when she succeeded David Cameron, and vowed to lead what she called a ""one nation"" government that works for all and not just the ""privileged few"".The speech is being seen by some as a ""re-launch"" or ""fightback"" after Mrs May lost her majority - and much of her authority - in the snap election last month.  In her speech, the PM will say that although the result of June's election was not what she wanted, ""those defining beliefs remain, my commitment to change in Britain is undimmed"".She will unveil a review - of casual and low-paid work - by Matthew Taylor, a former top adviser to Tony Blair, which she commissioned when she became prime minister.3:56Theresa May met her Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull in Downing StreetIt is thought Mr Taylor, who has been examining the use of zero-hours contracts and the rise in app-based firms such as Uber and Deliveroo, will stop short of calling for a compulsory minimum wage for those employed in the so-called gig economy, who do not have guaranteed hours or pay rates.But he is expected to propose a series of extra rights for those in insecure jobs and could also recommend shaking up the tax system to reduce the gap between employees and the self-employed.He is also likely to call for measures to improve job satisfaction for people working in minimum wage jobs, according to The Guardian.0:52The PM has a programme for Britain that will spread prosperity, the first secretary of state tells TodaySpeaking at a press conference with Australian counterpart Malcolm Turnbull on Monday, Mrs May said she had sought input from other parties in the past on issues like counter-terrorism and modern slavery.She also said she was happy to work with Labour's Yvette Cooper and others in a cross-party approach to tackling intimidation and online abuse of MPs and others involved in the political process.Asked if her desire for co-operation extended to Brexit, including on the government's Repeal Bill when it is published later this week, the prime minister said she was seeking the ""broadest possible consensus"" surrounding the terms of the UK's exit. PADamian Green: This is a grown up way of doing politicsLib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""A call for Labour to contribute is superfluous. On the single biggest issue of our generation, Brexit, Corbyn isn't contributing, he is cheerleading.""Scottish Government Brexit minister Michael Russell said: ""If the prime minister is genuinely interested in creating a consensus then Scotland should have a seat at the negotiations to leave the EU.""But Mr Green, who has known Mrs May since university and is effectively her deputy prime minister, said the public would welcome a move away from politics in which parties ""just sit in the trenches and shell each other"".The BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, said that the Conservatives and Labour were ""poles apart"" on many significant policy areas.He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""More brutally, Jeremy Corbyn is not minded to help Theresa May.

"10 March 2023","What's happening in Parliament this week?","What's happening in Parliament this week?10 March 2023ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentSharePA MediaTwo government priorities, the Illegal Migration Bill and Budget, go through the House of Commons next week.Hard politics is back in the Commons this week - with a vengeance. The week opens with the Commons initial debate on the highly controversial Illegal Migration Bill. Then it will be dominated by the announcement of the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt's first Budget and the ensuing debate, which extends into the first two days of the following week. The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillWhen is the Budget and what could it mean for my money?Amidst the hubbub the deadline for considering the much-revised - and still in limbo - Online Safety Bill will be extended by 18 weeks, until 20 July. In the Lords there's an interesting sub-plot developing around the Financial Services and Markets Bill.It is due to complete its Committee Stage on Monday. This is one of those complex technical measures debated in Grand Committee, rather than on the floor of the House. The process has ground on to a record length. When it moves back to the Chamber at Report Stage, look out for an amendment from the Chair of the Lords Economic Affairs Committee, Lord Bridges. He wants to create a backstop body to keep an eye on the work of the Financial Conduct Authority. The government doesn't like the idea - so watch this space. Monday 13 March Commons: (14:30 GMT) Defence Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30. Given the Speaker's displeasure after the government announced delays to the HS2 high speed rail programme in a written ministerial answer late last Thursday, this looks a highly probable subject for a government statement or urgent question. Also, look out for another rebuke from the Chair to ministers - not that they seem to have any effect.Main debate: Second Reading of the Illegal Migration Bill. It is a measure of the angst around this bill that there are already no fewer than four amendments to decline a second reading, from Labour, the Lib Dems, the Labour left (plus the SDLP, Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts and the Green Party's Dr Caroline Lucas) and from the SNP. The Speaker normally selects the official Opposition amendment. Getty ImagesIn total, 45,755 migrants crossed the Channel last yearThe government is fast-tracking the bill, with two six-hour days of detailed debate on the floor of the Commons. I assume they will follow next week.Day one is devoted to the meat of the bill: The clauses limiting the ability to suspend deportation under the European Convention of Human Rights and capping the number of entrants to the UK under safe and legal routes.Day two will deal with the remainder - including clauses permanently banning people from the UK if they've entered illegally.Westminster Hall (16:30): A three hour debate on e-petition 623390, ""Make suicide prevention a compulsory part of the school curriculum"". This petition, which attracted 158,000 signatures, was started by the campaign group 3 Dads Walking. Committees: Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:00) Committee will question witnesses from the planning, local authority, and housing sectors on reforms to national planning policy for England.Lords: (14:30) day four of detailed scrutiny of the Levelling-Up and Regeneration Bill.  The number of days of Committee consideration has been pushed up from eight to ten, to accommodate the vast list of amendments.Tuesday 14 March Commons: (11:30) Foreign Office Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Conservative MP Paul Holmes. He wants a new planning presumption against new quarries near settlements. Main debate: Then it is on to backbench debates. First on homelessness among Ukrainian refugees in the UK - where there are warnings that increasing numbers face homelessness or destitution. Conservative Bob Blackman leads. The second debate is on the seizure of Russian assets. Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, arguing that Russian assets held in the UK should be seized to help the Ukrainian government rebuild devastated infrastructure. Westminster Hall: Backbench debate on extending the lease for to 150 years London Zoo to allow it greater confidence in investing in facilities. Conservative Bob Blackman leads. Then at 16:00 Labour's Andy McDonald leads a debate on the new Middlesbrough Development Corporation. This is a highly controversial issue in the region, pitting Conservative Metro Mayor Ben Houchen against local Labour MPs and councillors. It's only half an hour but there could be considerable Red Wall crossfire. Committees: The day's main event is the joint evidence session held by the Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Justice committees starts at 10:15. MPs are investigating forced installation of expensive pre-payment meters in the homes of energy customers. They're combining to question British Gas owner Centrica, energy company Utilita, debt enforcement agencies and a former magistrate about the legal and commercial aspects of the forced installations. Lords: (14:30) Peers respond to Commons amendments to the Public Order Bill and the UK Infrastructure Bank Bill, before looking at the detail of the Trade (Australia and New Zealand) Bill.Wednesday 15 MarchCommons: (11:30) It is the debut question session for the new Science Innovation and Technology Department, followed, at Noon, by Prime Minister's Question Time. Main debate: The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt presents his budget, triggering four days of debate on whatever it contains.Westminster Hall: Labour's Kevan Jones, who has talked about his own mental health issues leads a debate on the Mental Health and Wellbeing Plan (11:00). Conservative Peter Bone leads a debate on human trafficking and modern slavery (14:30).Committees: Environmental Audit (14:15) quizzes Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary Grant Shapps. On the agenda is energy efficiency, strategy on solar and renewable energy, and plans for how the UK's offshore oil and gas sector will meet emissions reduction targets.Lords: Day five on the detail of the Levelling-Up Bill, plus a short debate on how the Barnett Formula distributes taxpayer's money around the nations and regions of the UK.Thursday 16 March Commons: (09:30) Cabinet Office Questions, which may be more than usually lively, given the Sue Gray saga. This is followed by the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House.Main debate: Continuation of the Budget debate - it extends until Tuesday 21 March.Westminster Hall: First, there is a debate on relations with China during the presidency of Xi Jinping (13:30). The DUP's Jim Shannon wants to highlight the Uyghur genocide in Xinjiang and the threats to Taiwan. Second is a debate on car parking for care workers (15:00). The Conservative Damien Moore want to propose free car parking passes for carers on duty, making home visitsLords: Peers have their debate on the Budget.Friday 17 MarchCommons: It is another day devoted to laws proposed by individual MPs. The first four bills are all on the final straight, having emerged unscathed from scrutiny in committee. They now face Report Stage  - where any MP can propose changes - and Third Reading. First up is the Conservative Henry Smith's Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill.The Child Support (Enforcement) Bill aims to improve the recovery of arrears from parents who to pay child maintenance. It is proposed by the Conservative Siobhan Baillie, a family law solicitor.The Powers of Attorney Bill, by Conservative Stephen Metcalfe, wants to the process of making and registering a lasting power of attorney to be safer and easier. Then it is the Animals (Low Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill. Conservative MP Angela Richardson wants to ban the sale and the advertisement in England, Wales and Northern Ireland of low-welfare animal activities, like elephant rides, dolphinariums and close encounters with big cats. With detailed debate on four different bills, there probably won't be much time available for the Second Reading of the Palestine Statehood (Recognition) Bill, from the Lib Dem Layla Moran, still less the Chalk Streams (Protection) Bill from her colleague Sarah Green.Lords: Not sitting.

"28 June 2019","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament28 June 2019ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareGetty ImagesDame Margaret Beckett is behind one of the latest move to block a no-deal BrexitAfter long weeks becalmed in the parliamentary doldrums, Westminster will be moving again next week - with a couple of significant moments expected. On Brexit there's an innovative backbench attempt to block a no-deal exit, and the long awaited publication of Gemma White QC's independent inquiry into bullying and harassment within the parliamentary community is expected early in the week. Both could generate considerable aftershocks.First the Brexit manoeuvre. The Labour former Foreign Secretary, Dame Margaret Beckett, and the Conservative former Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, have come up with a new line of attack. They're proposing amendments in next week's Estimates Day debates which would block the funding of key government departments: international development, education, work and pensions and housing, unless MPs agree a Brexit outcome. In other words they aim to make it impossible for the government to bypass Parliament and impose a no-deal exit from the EU, because if ministers did, the flow of cash to government services would stop. To succeed, this will need Labour to whip in support and deliver most, if not all, its troops, as well as the support of independents and the smaller parties; and after talking to both pro-Brexit and Remain Labour MPs, I doubt they will fancy the idea of switching off large chunks of government spending on top of a no-deal exit.The estimates are the formal process by which MPs approve the spending of taxpayers' money, and despite recent attempts to make them a more meaningful exercise, they remain something of an empty ritual. But if these amendments were passed (there's one for each department) there would be real impact; the amendments must then be written into the otherwise unamendable Supply and Estimates Main Appropriations Bill that goes before MPs on Wednesday.  This is one of the relatively few opportunities for opponents of a no-deal exit to seek to block it in the Commons, and the number of Conservative votes for the amendments will be an interesting barometer of the mood of Tory Remainers, and an important indicator of the scale of the parliamentary challenge which will confront the incoming prime minister. At the moment Mr Grieve's name is joined by that of ex-minister Phillip Lee; will more rebels join them?There are also hints the cross-party alliance behind this manoeuvre may have further tricks up its collective sleeve. Suddenly everyone seems to be on a three-line whip for Wednesday, which suggests more action to come - perhaps another Letwin-style amendment to the Business of the House Motion, to set aside another Commons day for some anti-Brexit legislation? There is also some Brexit action in the Lords, where peers will debate a motion calling for the creation of a joint Commons Lords Committee, to report on the impact of a no-deal Brexit. Life at the bottom of the Commons pecking orderOn the abuse of staff, the Gemma White report has been in the pipeline for a while - its focus is on bullying and mistreatment of staff working directly with MPs - and the parliamentary authorities are braced for another hammer blow to their institution. It should lead to more action to protect staff, but the key thing to watch is whether generalised statements of support from the bewildering number of players in the administration of the Commons are matched by a concrete action plan. Will they, for example, launch inquiries into historic allegations against a number of prominent figures? The point about this is staff have to have confidence in any complaints system - and maybe the only way to achieve that if for a well-known figure to publicly named and shamed. And finally there's significant movement in the campaign to allow medical use of cannabis. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:Monday 1 JulyThe Commons week begins (14:30 BST) with Work and Pensions Questions, after which the normal crop of post weekend ministerial statements and urgent questions will doubtless appear.The day's main event is a Estimates Day debate on government spending estimates for the Department for International Development and the Department for Education, complete with Beckett-Grieve amendments (see above). There are also a more conventional amendment from the Labour front bench, calling for a government report on the impact of the spending plans on issue like child poverty and social justice.The day ends with an adjournment debate on children's palliative care - with the Conservative, Dr Caroline Johnson, pointing to the patchy provision of an essential service. In Westminster Hall (16:30), Daniel Zeichner will lead a debate on e-petition 239444 which calls for homophobia to be made a specific criminal offence. It attracted 152,458 signatures. The government responded to the petition in March recognising the ""harm that homophobic online messages can cause"". They say they are ""working cross-government to challenge inequality and make the UK's online environment a safer place"". On the Committee Corridor, the Public Accounts Committee (16:00) has a session on penalty charge notices in healthcare. They will be examining whether the system is failing - with millions in fines uncollected and millions having to be repaid. In the Lords (14:30) questions include Labour's Lord Haskel asking about the motion by the House of Commons declaring an environment and climate emergency.The main debates are on two select committee reports the Chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee Lord Forsyth of Drumlean will raise their recommendations of their report on measuring inflation which found that the UK Statistics Authority is at risk of being in breach of its statutory duties on the publication of statistics, by refusing to correct an error that it openly admits exists in the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The report calls for the authority to follow the procedure for correcting the error and resume a programme of regular methodological improvements. It also recommends a single measure of general inflation for use by the government.Next, Lord Bassam of Brighton will lead a debate on the report from his Select Committee on Regenerating Seaside Towns and Communities: The future of seaside towns. This warned of a long-term decline in domestic tourism, fishing, shipbuilding and port activities, with seaside towns facing neglect. It recommends that the Local Enterprise Partnerships should support seaside regeneration through Local Industrial Strategies.How seaside towns are fighting backTuesday 2 JulyWill this be the Chancellor Philip Hammond's final question time? He's been increasingly outspoken in recent weeks, and Treasury Questions (11:30) could provide him with the chance for another jeremiad about the promises for tax cuts and extra spending emanating from the Conservative leadership contenders. Conservative MP Andrew Griffiths has a Ten Minute Rule Bill to entitle women aged under 40 and with a family history of breast cancer to breast screening services, and then it's back to Estimates Day debates, this time covering the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Housing. Communities and Local Government.In Westminster Hall Labour's Chris Bryant leads a debate (9:30)  on Acquired Brain Injury (ABI).  He is the chair of the All-Party Group on ABI, and he wants to highlight the extent of the injury and the need to improve the support and services.Former Defra minister George Eustice leads a debate on the religious slaughter of farm animals (11:00). There are concerns that the failure to stun animals before killing them under some methods of slaughter is cruel, and that Halal and Kosher meat should be labelled by method of slaughter. In 2014, the All Party Group for Beef and Lamb conducted an inquiry into non-stun slaughter in accordance with religious rites and whether the right of Freedom of Religious Expression outweighs animal welfare considerations.On the Committee Corridor, following the government's recent change in the law to commit the UK to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Treasury Committee (9:30) takes evidence on decarbonisation and green finance. And there's a session on drugs policy at the Health and Social Care Committee (14:30) with witnesses including senior police officer and pressure groups.In the Lords (14:30) proceedings open with the introduction of the new Bishop of Derby the Rt Rev Libby Lane. She was the first woman ever to be appointed a bishop in the Church of England, in 2015. But because she was appointed initially as a suffragan (junior) bishop, she had to wait a while because it is only the more senior diocesans who enter the Lords. After four years as Bishop of Stockport in the Chester diocese, she was made Bishop of Derby earlier this year. Her arrival brings the total of female bishops in the Lords up to five (of the 26). The others are, in order of entry, Gloucester, Newcastle, London and Bristol. The introduction will itself be a bit of a rarity, because it will be conducted by both Archbishops, Canterbury and York.Then peers will approve the third reading of the Courts and Tribunals (Online Procedure) Bill before debating the Augar Review of post-18 education and funding.Wednesday 3 July The Commons day begins (11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland questions - will this be the swansong for Secretary of State Karen Bradley? And then it's Prime Minister's Question Time, which has become a rather diminished occasion, with most Conservative MPs not bothering to turn up (one count had just 99 Tories present on the green benches during this week's PMQs). Maybe the player to watch is the SNP's Ian Blackford, who for the last two weeks has been pushing the boundaries of permitted parliamentary language, in his attacks on Tory Leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson; will he double down this week, and add to the accusations he has already made of lying and racism. So far the Speaker has not risen to the bait and ordered him to withdraw the offending words, perhaps suspecting that the SNP leader rather hopes to be ordered out of the chamber - something his predecessor Alex Salmond never minded. But Mr Blackford may be reaching the limits of the Chair's tolerance. UK PARLIAMENT/JESSICA TAYLORThe day's Ten Minute Rule Motion from the Lib Dem ex-Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael calls for the government to set targets for the reduction of plastic pollution - and for the government to produce an annual report on progress. Next there's the Supply and Appropriation (Main Estimates) (No. 3) Bill, which may or may not include amendments from the previous day's estimates debates. This is normally a brief rubber stamping exercise, with all the Commons stages taken in a single gulp. MPs will also be asked to approve the statutory instruments on Capital Allowances (Structures and Buildings Allowances) Regulations and on the Misuse of Drugs Act. That last one is highly significant, because it amends the definition of a range of synthetic cannabinoids currently classified as Class B drugs under the Act  to remove the ban on compounds now known to have legitimate medical uses This follows the long parliamentary campaign in around the case of Alfie Dingley whose seizures can only be controlled with cannabis-based medicines.  Alfie Dingley cannabis treatment 'amazing'The Backbench Business Committee have scheduled a debate on whistleblowing with former Health Minister Norman Lamb and the Conservative Stephen Kerr calling for a review of whistleblowing regulation. The key issue is whether the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act provides sufficient protection for a broader range of people. Mr Kerr (chair) and Mr Lamb (vice-chair) head up the All-Party Parliamentary Group on whistleblowing and its importance in a transparent society. MPs will debate the effectiveness of the 1998 Public Interest Disclosure Act which was introduced to protect employees who speak out. The APPG believes the act needs to be reformed to stop unfair practice of whistleblowers losing their jobs. Norman Lamb, the former health minister has urged the government to look into the treatment of whistleblowers in the NHS in light of the treatment of the nurses who tried to ""blow the whistle"" in the 1991. 456 people lost their lives as a result of the prescribing of opioids. Mr Lamb set up the Gosport inquiry when he was health minister and attempted to transform the NHS care programme in 2012.PA MediaIn Westminster Hall (9:30)  the Conservative Trudy Harrison will lead the debate in Westminster Hall on the red squirrel - the Wildlife Trust has predicted that red squirrels could become extinct in England in 10 years, because of competition from grey squirrels. Then at 14:30, there will be a debate over investment in the provision of English for speakers of other languages, particularly for refugees. It's led by Labour's Preet Kaur Gill who has been lobbying the government to improve access to ESOL provision for refugee women who have childcare and caring responsibilities. She is also a big supporter of speech, language and communication support for children. Last year she told the Commons that in 1978, as an eleven-year-old immigrant, she had the opportunity to move to England and learn English within six months.On the Committee Corridor, the International Trade Committee hears from Secretary of State Dr Liam Fox (10:00). I daresay the implications of a no-deal Brexit might come up. In the Lords (15:00) the main event is the Labour-led motion calling for a joint committee of Lords and Commons be appointed to report, by 30 September, on the costs and implications for the UK of exiting the EU without a withdrawal agreement on 31 October 2019. The motion has been tabled by shadow leader of the Lords, Labour's Baroness Angela Smith with support from the Liberal Democrat leader Dick Newby, security and intelligence expert David Anderson from the Crossbenches, and the Conservative Lord Patrick Cormack. Given the overwhelmingly pro-EU composition of the Lords, this will probably be approved, but it would also need the backing of the Commons, and it may not even be discussed there.The sunken ammunition ship the SS Richard Montgomery lies in the Thames EstuaryFinally, there's a short debate on ""Mitigating the risks posed by the wreck of SS Richard Montgomery"" - this is an American cargo ship which sank in the Thames Estuary in 1944, carrying 1400 tons of munitions. Labour's Lord Harris of Haringey would like the government to take responsibility for the surveillance of the wreck. It is generally agreed that the bombs are relatively safe as long as they aren't exposed to sudden shock, friction or heat. But recent surveys confirm the wreck is gradually disintegrating, and if it collapsed that could cause the sympathetic detonation of the remaining explosives, with potentially devastating consequences.The ticking time bomb of the ThamesThursday 4 July The Commons day begins (9:30 am) with Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Questions, followed by questions to the Attorney General and the weekly Business Questions to the Leader of the House, Mel Stride.The two main debates are on motions chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - the first is another offshoot of the plan to move Britain to a zero-carbon economy, a call to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans. Under current plans, the government's goal is for all new cars and vans to be ""effectively zero-emission"" by 2040. But there are calls to bring the target forward to 2032, including from the Business Select Committee Chair, Labour's Rachel Reeves, who wants the ban to be brought forward to 2032. She is calling for an ""effectively zero-emission target"". That is followed by a general debate on the law on assisted dying. Following the defeat of the last attempt at legalisation, the Assisted Dying (No.2) Bill, which would have allowed a terminally ill person to be given assistance to end their life, in September 2015. This debate will focus on the circumstances in which it should be possible for people to be assisted to die. Its main sponsors are the Independent Conservative, Nick Boles who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life, the former Health Minister Norman Lamb and Labour's Sarah Champion.In Westminster Hall (13:30) the Chair of the International Development Committee, Labour's Stephen Twigg, leads a debate on their report on ""Forced Displacement in Africa: Anchors not walls"". Getty ImagesFour million of Venezuelans have left their country since 2015 due to the social, political and economic crisisThe report found that there are 68.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide - 20 million of which live in Sub-Saharan Africa, including 13 million internally displaced people (IDPs), 5.6 million refugees and over 700,000 stateless individuals. It urges the government to 'practice what it preaches' when it comes to its policies on migration and forced displacement and to look to adopt a cross-government approach and national strategy.That is followed by a debate over the changes to immigration rules for religious workers (15:00). Concerns over the working of so-called Tier 5 of the Religious Worker Visas will be raised by David Linden (SNP), Paul Masterton (Conservative) and Ged Killen (Labour). The issue is a new 'cooling-off period' which prevents Tier 5 Religious and Charity Worker visa holders from returning to the UK for 12 months after their visa expires. In the Lords (11:00) the main debates are on protecting the NHS in future trade deals entered into by the UK; the apprenticeship levy and the case for the effective delivery of workplace opportunities for young people and the role of reducing inequality and job insecurity in tackling the prevalence of mental illness - that last is led by the Crossbencher and Big Issue founder, Lord Bird.Friday 5 JulyNeither the Commons nor the Lords will be sitting - but the UK Youth Parliament's select committee on knife crime will be in action, taking evidence from four panels of witnesses, including the Home Office Minister, Victoria Atkins.

"14 June 2018","Brexit: MPs reject bid to stay in EEA amid Labour revolt","Brexit: MPs reject bid to stay in EEA amid Labour revolt14 June 2018ShareSharePAAnti-Brexit campaigners have been protesting outside the Houses of Parliament every dayAttempts to keep the UK in the European Economic Area after Brexit have been defeated in the House of Commons despite dozens of Labour MPs defying the leader's instructions on the issue.MPs voted by 327 to 126 against a House of Lords proposal for a close relationship with the EU like Norway's.Jeremy Corbyn urged his MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against, while six quit their Labour roles.MPs overturned six further amendments peers had put forward.What was the vote about?MPs were deciding whether the UK should stay part of the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU - a similar arrangement to non-EU countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Like EU members, these countries are part of the EU single market - in return they are obliged to make a financial contribution and accept many EU laws. The free movement of people also applies in the zone as it does in the EU.Supporters of the EEA argue it would give the UK the closest possible relationship with the EU without actually being a member, as it would offer full access to the single market.But critics say it would require the UK to adhere to EU rules without having a say in them - and would not be in keeping with the spirit of the 2016 referendum result.After the House of Lords altered the government's EU Withdrawal Bill in favour of EEA membership, the House of Commons agreed to change it back on Wednesday evening.The government won the vote comfortably after Labour abstained, although three Tory MPs, Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, rebelled themselves and backed the motion.PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances'

Labour MPs were dividedJeremy Corbyn said EEA membership was ""not the right option"" for Britain but that he understood the difficulties the issue posed for MPs representing strongly Leave or Remain constituencies.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour MP Laura Smith defended her decision to quit as shadow defence minister because she did not want to follow the leader's instruction to abstain.The MP for Crewe and Nantwich said she wanted to oppose the Lords amendment, saying remaining part of the EEA was not in the interests of her constituents who had voted to leave the EU in 2016.UK ParliamentLabour MPs Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi have stepped down from their frontbench rolesMs Smith, who backed Remain in the referendum, said there were ""legitimate reasons"" why people had backed Brexit, adding: ""The country is divided on this issue and we need to start bringing people together.""On the other side of the debate were her Labour colleagues Ged Killen, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin, Ellie Reeves and Rosie Duffield who stepped down as parliamentary private secretaries to support EEA membership.In her resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Reeves said her Lewisham West and Penge constituency had voted by two to one to stay in the EU and hundreds had contacted her in support of staying part of the EEA. Earlier, Labour failed in an attempt to amend the bill with their own alternative motion to guarantee ""full access"" to European markets after Brexit from outside the EEA. This was defeated by 322 votes to 240..MPs quit Labour roles over Brexit voteSNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protestWestminster sausage machineBy political editor Laura KuenssbergA wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made.Well the last 48 hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime.Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two.Read more from LauraWhy were MPs voting about Brexit?The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.MPs also overturned other changes made to the bill by the Lords, including a requirement for ministers to set out steps to negotiate a customs union with the EU.The government agreed a compromise with potential Tory rebels earlier this week to work towards a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU. This won the support of the Commons by 325 votes to 298.Other changes insisted upon by the Lords relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, principles of EU law to be retained after Brexit and EU environmental principles were also removed.  In response to the votes, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable accused Labour of conspiring with the Conservatives to ""wave through a hard Brexit"".But ministers did make one significant policy concession - on refugee policy after Brexit.They accepted a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to widen the terms under which unaccompanied child refugees can be reunited with family members living in the UK.

The government had already agreed to allow unaccompanied children to claim asylum in the UK if it was deemed to be in their ""best interests"".But, following Ms Cooper's intervention, ministers have agreed to drop a clause stating this could only happen if their family members already in the UK were over 18 years of age. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said ministers had listened ""very carefully"" to the views of MPs from different parties and would amend the bill when it returns to the Lords next week.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44474661"

"13 April 2018","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament13 April 2018ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareEPA/AFP/GettyDefence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Environment Secretary Michael Gove leave the Cabinet after ministers agreed ""on the need to take action"" in Syria to ""deter the further use of chemical weapons""Even more than usual, next week's parliamentary agenda looks like a basis for negotiation, with every likelihood that the timetable will have to be reorganised to accommodate a series of major statements and perhaps a full-scale debate on military action in Syria. As I write, no action has taken place, but one way or another such a debate looks highly likely, because the Opposition will certainly demand one, and this Speaker would surely allow an application for an emergency debate, if only to maintain the precedent of recent years for a parliamentary vote before military action. So the government might well decide it was not worth having a fight over whether to hold it, when it would probably lose. Does Theresa May need MPs to approve UK action in Syria?Syria: What can Western military intervention achieve?And in parallel with those events, the Lords will be voting on what could prove to be highly significant changes to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. Amendments are flying thick and fast, and the final deadline for the first Report Stage debate is on Monday, so more will doubtless emerge. The first big vote will probably be on a cross-party amendment to keep the UK in ""an arrangement which enables the United Kingdom to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union."" The key point about this amendment is its cross-party backing - its proposers are Lord Kerr of Kinlochard (a crossbencher and former diplomat); Conservative grandee Lord Patten of Barnes; Labour's Brexit spokespeer, Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town and her Lib Dem opposite number Baroness Ludford. The point here is that it is not amendments from a single party that assemble enough support to defeat the government, but grand cross-party coalitions. This one (and plenty more to come) tick that box, by assembling Tory Europhiles and big-name crossbenchers alongside the opposition parties.Meanwhile the government does seem to be moving on a series of issues raised by the Lords' highly influential Constitution Committee, on such issues as the exact status of retained EU law and the ability of UK courts to consider judgments of the European Court of Justice, post-Brexit. Ministers have put down their own amendments on these and other issues, and the response from some of their key critics seems favourable. This looks like a smart move, because the Lords were very likely to back amendments from influential constitutionalists, had ministers not moved first - and it signalled a willingness to listen.With key Brexit measures like the Trade Bill still being held back, the Commons schedule has a series of general debates, on housing, industrial strategy and anti-Semitism. Up on the committee corridor the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee has two more instalments of its Fake News inquiry - including, on Wednesday, the recall of Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix. Here's my rundown of the week ahead:MondayThe Commons resumes at 2.30pm - where the opening event is Home Office questions. After that expect any number of post-recess statements and urgent questions. With Home Secretary Amber Rudd already in the chamber, it might be a good moment to raise the upsurge of knife crime in London, for example. The day's legislating is on the second reading of the almost completely uncontroversial Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill - which makes it a specific offence to shine a laser into the eyes of a driver or pilot. This, and the ensuing general debate on Housing and Homes, look eminently postpone-able, if there is more urgent business to discuss. If it goes ahead, the housing debate will provide ministers with an opportunity to highlight what they see as a policy success in increasing new home starts, and for Labour to fire back on homelessness and a lack of social housing and affordable housing. It will also be a test for the new Housing Minister, Dominic Raab, who has been catapulted into a sensitive policy brief from his previous berth as a Brexit minister - and he will be up against Labour's Jon Healey, who is an experienced former housing minister.The day ends with an interesting looking adjournment debate, led by up-and-coming Conservative lawyer Alex Chalk, on the effect of cyber-bullying on young people's mental health. He called this debate publishing a report with Young Minds and The Children's Society, with evidence from over 1,000 young people, plus experts and representatives from the social media giants. He says it's clear that cyber bullying wrecks lives and has a toxic effect on adolescent mental health, and that the issue needs to be tackled robustly.ReutersIn Westminster Hall (4.30pm), the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on a series of petitions on human rights abuses against the Muslim Rohingya people, by the security forces in Myanmar's Rakhine State, which has resulted in a humanitarian crisis as refugees pour into neighbouring Bangladesh.MPs will debate e-petition 200224: ""impose harsh financial sanctions on the State of Myanmar due to the current ongoing ethnic cleansing being pursued by elements of its security forces,"" which attracted 30,349 signatures, and e-petition 200371, which says: ""Hundreds have been forced to flee their villages as the emergency situation in Myanmar has worsened. Urgent needs of displaced people include water, hygiene facilities, food & shelter,"" which was signed by 1,451 people, as well as a series of related public petitions.In the Lords (2.30pm) peers will rattle through a series of orders and regulations before debating a motion to approve, for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, the government's assessment of the medium term economic and fiscal position. They will also have a short debate on developing a sustainable lifelong learning culture in England, led by the Lib Dem,Baroness Garden of Frognal.The Commons opens (11.30 am) with Treasury questions, with the probability of more urgent questions or ministerial statements to come at 12.30pm. Conservative MP Bim Afolami has a ten minute rule motion on drug testing in prisons, and then comes a general debate on anti-Semitism. European Photopress AgencyThis addresses a painful and politically radioactive issue - and the word is that so many MPs have already put down to speak, that speeches will be kept very short. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid opens for the government, with Andrew Gwynne leading for Labour - and there will be considerable interest in whether Jeremy Corby attends, or speaks. The debate was chosen by the government, and there will doubtless be attempts to maximise Labour's divisions, after the events of recent weeks. Next comes a debate chosen by the Backbench Business Committee, on a motion calling for redress for victims of banking misconduct - the particular focus is the report into the conduct of the RBS Global Restructuring Group (GRG) and the issues it raises about the strength and independence of the Financial Conduct Authority; the motion calls for further inquiries into RBS GRG by a body independent to the FCA - and an independent inquiry into the financial services sector. In Westminster Hall, the subjects for debate include: reducing fly-tipping (9.30am-11am) led by the chair of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee, Neil Parish; health services in Essex (11am-11.30am) led by the former Cabinet minister, Priti Patel; the effect of the UK leaving the EU on tourism and the creative industries (2.30pm) led by Lib Dem Christine Jardine; the sale of energy drinks to children (4pm) led by Labour's Anna Turley, and future trade remedies after the UK leaves the EU (4.30pm) led by the Conservative, Jack Brereton. On the committee corridor, the Justice Committee winds up its inquiry into Transforming Rehabilitation with evidence from Dame Glenys Stacey, HM Chief Inspector of Probation, and the prisons minister, Rory Stewart (10am). And the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee continues its Fake News inquiry with evidence from Brittany Kaiser, former Director of Program Development, at Cambridge Analytica (10.30 am). In the Lords (2.30 pm) questions to ministers include the Conservative historian, Lord Lexden, on an independent inquiry into Operation Conifer - the two-year, million-pound Wiltshire police inquiry, into allegations of rape and sexual assault against the former prime minister, the late Sir Edward Heath. The day's main legislating is on the report stage of the Haulage Permits and Trailer Registration Bill - a mini-Brexit bill designed to provide a framework for the haulage industry, post Brexit.Labour's Lord Kennedy of Southwark has a regret motion down against the Housing and Planning Act 2016 (Database of Rogue Landlords and Property Agents) Regulations 2018 - which provides a list of bad landlords. His complaint, harking back to the 2016 Housing and Planning Act, is that it can only be accessed by local councils and public bodies, and is not available for prospective tenants to check out their landlords. His motion is backed by the Lib Dems and the government has been attempting to head off possible defeat with an ""All Peers"" letter saying it is looking at ways to give tenants access. And finally, there's a short debate on addressing obesity among children and young people.The Commons opens (11.30am) with half an hour of International Development questions, followed at noon by PMQs. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from Labour's Steve McCabe, is on access to fertility services including requiring that a minimum number of fertility treatments are available to women on the basis of their age.MPs then polish off the committee and third reading stages of the Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill, before moving on to another general debate - this time on industrial strategy.The day's Westminster Hall debates are on the work of the Council of Europe (9.30am) led by Labour's Vernon Coaker; the effect of the UK leaving the EU on the veterinary profession in Wales (11am) led by Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake; the future of the UK digital and tech industries (2.30pm) led by the Conservative Anne Main; REAF the Renaissance for East Anglian Fishing campaign  (4pm) led by Conservative Peter Aldous, and austerity and changes in life expectancy (4.30pm) led by Labour's Louise Haigh.My committee corridor picks are the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs hearing on the fur trade in the UK (9.30am) with witnesses from Amazon, Not On The High Street, Fur Europe, the British Fur Trade Association, and the International Fur Federation.And watch out for the second Fake News hearing from the Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee, with the recalled witness, Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica. In the Lords (3pm), questions to ministers include the Lib Dem, Lord Tyler, asking whether current electoral law adequately prevents the misuse of personal data in UK elections and referendum campaigns. 3:38Lords stake out positions on Brexit bill, at the start of the bill's progressAnd then it's showtime  - the first report stage debate on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill - with the prospect of actual votes and the distinct possibility of a government defeat on the cross party amendment on ""a"" customs union. One point to watch out for is the scale of any anti-government majority; the ultimate aim of these votes is to set up an opportunity for the government to be defeated in the Commons - so a big majority in the Lords provides a bit of psychological reinforcement for wavering Conservative MPs. On the long-established principle that in the Lords, much depends on dinner, expect the big votes to be held between about 4.30pm and 7.30pm. I don't often highlight Lords Select Committees, but the Constitution Committee hearing (9.45am) on Parliament's role in relation to the terms of Brexit, with Brexit minister Steve Baker and Suella Braverman (formerly Fernandes) could provide quite an interesting appetiser for the debates in the main chamber. Will the Lords try to block Brexit?Lords stake out their positions on EU withdrawal bill - BBC NewsEssentially they will be looking at what kind of leverage the various possible parliamentary votes on Brexit could exert on the policy of the government.  For example, will the much-touted ""meaningful vote"" be a choice between accepting the withdrawal agreement in full, or leaving the EU without any deal? What might happen if Parliament approved the withdrawal deal, but rejected the political declaration on the framework for a future UK-EU relationship? How long would MPs and peers get to study the agreements before being asked to vote on them and will the government publish an impact analysis? All big important procedural questions which will shape the vital debates due in the autumn. Some of these issues have been raised in written questions by crossbench peer Viscount Waverley - and the response has been some pretty straight batted non-answers. Will the two ministers go further? This is not a committee that responds well to stonewalling...The Commons convenes at 9.30am for Transport questions, followed at 10.30am by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom. And then, assuming no further ministerial statements or urgent questions, it is on to a series of backbench business debates. First, there is a motion on surgical mesh, backing the decision to hold a retrospective audit of its use to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence and calling on the government to suspend prolapse and incontinence mesh operations while the audit is carried out - and to commit to a full public inquiry into mesh if the audit suggests that this is the best course of action.Then MPs turn to a motion on cancer treatment mirroring the very powerful debate led by Tessa Jowell in the House of Lords in January.  Baroness Jowell was diagnosed with a brain tumour last May and has been campaigning for improvements to treatment, patient care, and clinical trials. The motion proposed by Labour's Sarah Jones pays tribute to her work recognises the government's increased funding for research and calls on the government to increase the sharing of health data and promote greater use of adaptive clinical trials.In the Lords (11am) peers debate the detail of the Registration of Marriage Bill which reforms the way in which marriages are registered in England and Wales, moving from a paper-based system to registration in an electronic register. Among other things, it will allow the inclusion of each spouses' mother in the marriage entry. Then peers debate the report from the committee on the Long-term Sustainability of the NHS - which found that ""a culture of short-termism seems to prevail in the NHS and adult social care"". It argued that the Department of Health and almost everyone involved in the health service and social care system were absorbed by the day-to-day struggles, leaving the future to ""take care of itself"". The report called for a new political consensus on the future of the health and care system based on government-initiated cross-party talks and a robust national conversation. Peers will also debate a report from the EU External Affairs Committee: Brexit: sanctions policy.Neither House sits on Friday 20 April.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43757563"
"27 December 2023","Labour considers processing asylum seekers overseas","Labour considers processing asylum seekers overseas27 December 2023ShareFiona Nimoni, Iain WatsonBBC NewsSharePA MediaThe Labour party is considering processing some asylum claims overseas if it forms the next government. Sir Keir Starmer has been looking over new plans for Labour's asylum policy, a spokesman told the BBC.Asked last week if his party would consider processing asylum claims outside of the UK, Sir Keir said he would look at any plan that works.The Conservatives accused Labour of having no credible plan to stop migrants coming to the UK in boats.The Labour party is exploring whether some asylum seekers could have their claims processed before reaching the UK, to discourage some of them from making the journey across the Channel.Multiple senior sources have told the BBC that shadow ministers and officials have been discussing this as part of a mix of measures to tackle crossings. However, no detailed plans have yet been drawn up.The sources denied reports in The Times on Tuesday that detailed plans had been drawn up.Labour has ruled out any option that could see asylum seekers deported to other countries while their claims are being assessed - the cornerstone of Rishi Sunak's Rwanda scheme.Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Sunak takes the win but the battle is not overCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Speaking to the BBC earlier this month Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said she opposed the Rwanda scheme because it came with a ""huge cost"" and would only see a small number of people sent to Rwanda.Under a five-year trial first announced by the government in April 2022,  some asylum seekers arriving in the UK could be sent to Rwanda for processing.On arrival, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay. If not, they could apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another ""safe third country"".The government has been unable to send a single asylum seeker to Rwanda because of various legal challenges. The Supreme Court ruled the policy was unlawful in November and new emergency legislation was drawn up to revive the government's plan.Many Tory MPs had originally threatened to vote down the bill and some on the right of the party rebelled by abstaining - including Robert Jenrick, who resigned as immigration minister over the legislation.While the bill passed its first vote in Parliament on 12 December, there will be further votes in the House of Commons in the new year which could pose a challenge for Rishi Sunak. A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC that ""as Keir said before, we'll look at anything that works but our priority is smashing the gangs and stopping people getting here in the first place, rather than working out how to process claims"".The government's Minister for Countering Illegal Immigration Michael Tomlinson said Labour's plans were not ""a deterrent to stop the boats, it just throws open the front door to Britain, increasing immigration. ""The National Crime Agency says that only a deterrent will stop the boats. Rishi Sunak's Rwanda plan is a deterrent,"" he said.A spokesman for Momentum, on the left wing of the Labour party, said that an expansion of safe routes for refugees was ""a practical alternative to the Tories' cruel and divisive war on migrants"".

"11 May 2024","Keir Starmer vows to scrap Rwanda asylum scheme 'straight away'","Keir Starmer vows to scrap Rwanda asylum scheme 'straight away'11 May 2024ShareSam Francis & Paul SeddonPolitical reporters, BBC NewsShareKeir Starmer tells the BBC's Chris Mason money from the Rwanda scheme should be spent on extra policingSir Keir Starmer has pledged to scrap the government's Rwanda scheme ""straight away"" if his party wins the election.The Labour leader said he would use money saved to hire specialist investigators to tackle small boats crossing the Channel.He also wants to use counter-terror powers to ""smash"" people smuggling gangs.Rishi Sunak said ministers had already recruited extra police in this area. Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister said ""we've got a plan, and we're going to get our planes off"".Sir Keir unveiled new details of his plan in Dover alongside local MP Natalie Elphicke, who defected from the Tories to Labour on Wednesday.In a brief speech, Ms Elphicke took a shot at her former boss, claiming ""nowhere is Rishi Sunak's lack of delivery clearer than on the issue of small boats"".How many people cross the Channel in small boats?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In his speech, the Labour leader said he will establish a new Border Security Command to work with Border Force, MI5 and the National Crime Agency on prosecuting gangs operating small boat routes.The party says this new unit would be led by a former police, military or intelligence chief, who would report directly to the home secretary.Sir Keir argued that scrapping the Rwanda scheme would free up £75m in the first year of a Labour government to hire hundreds of extra investigators and ""intelligence agents"".He has already pledged to cancel the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, which was first announced in 2022 but has been delayed by legal challenges.Ministers hope the scheme, now due to begin in July, will put people off trying to come to the UK across the English Channel in small boats.But Labour argues the scheme will not deter people from trying to make the journey.According to the National Audit Office, payments to Rwanda would cost £370m over five years, plus £120m if more than 300 people are moved, and £20,000 per individual relocated.Pressed on when his party would scrap the scheme, Sir Keir told reporters Labour would ""get rid of the policy straight away"".""I'm not going to continue a policy I don't think is going to work, which is going to cost a fortune,"" he added.Natalie Elphicke: Sunak has failed on small boatsWhen pushed on how large a reduction in small boat crossings he would like to see, the Labour leader did not set a figure but said he wanted levels to come down ""dramatically"". ""We will restore serious government to our borders, tackle this problem at source and replace the Rwanda policy permanently,"" he added.Sir Keir also said his party would expand powers under the Blair-era Terrorism Act to enable police to search people suspected of being involved in people smuggling.There would also be new powers enabling ""live monitoring"" of their financial accounts and court orders to hand over financial information.Suspected smugglers could also see their access to the internet, banking and travel restricted.Labour says these new powers would require fresh legislation to be passed in Parliament - something Sir Keir insisted would happen ""very quickly"".As first reported by The Times, the party also aims to negotiate access to the EU's Eurodac database, which records the fingerprints of people aged 14 and over who arrive in European countries without permission.Labour has not said whether this would involve implementing EU legislation underpinning the scheme. It says this would be a matter to be discussed during the negotiations.Peter Walsh, from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, said Labour's scheme was ""unlikely to be a game changer"".The plan ""appears on the face of it to be pretty similar"" to the current Small Boats Operational Command - the new military-led force which monitors and intercepts vessels attempting unauthorised entry into the UK via the Channel, he told BBC News.""The devil will be in the detail,"" he added.Both the Conservatives and Labour have accused each other of creating an ""amnesty"" - generally understood to mean allowing all those entering the country illegally to stay with a full legal pardon.Labour's plans, which the Conservatives have dubbed an ""amnesty for illegal immigrants"", will allow those arriving in the UK on small boats to apply for asylum - which is currently banned under the Illegal Migration Act. Labour have repeatedly denied they have plans for an amnesty on those entering the country illegally.Sir Keir accused the Conservatives of ""a Travelodge amnesty"" by not processing asylum claims and housing people in hotels instead - though the plans do not amount an amnesty either as they involve deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda.Nearly 9,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats so far this year, provisional Home Office figures show. This is up almost a third (32%) on the same period last year, when 6,691 people made the crossing, and a 14% rise compared with the same period in 2022 when the number of people was 7,750.Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationKeir StarmerImmigrationLabour Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68984778"
"11 May 2024","Chris Mason: Sunak, Starmer and their small boats row","Chris Mason: Sunak, Starmer and their small boats row11 May 2024ShareChris MasonPolitical editorShareReutersAs of 21 April, 6,265 people had crossed the English Channel in small boats since the start of 2024There is a single word at the heart of the political row between the prime minister and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer when it comes to unauthorised immigration.The word is amnesty.The issue of people in small boats crossing the English Channel is so contested, even the terminology of the topic is disputed.There are asylum seekers, who have applied for refugee status and are waiting for a decision. There are refugees. There is illegal immigration. Overlapping descriptions and labels, many of which provoke fury and anger. And so to that word - amnesty. Both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir are seeking to weaponize it, to make what they see as a negative point about their opponent. The Labour leader accused Mr Sunak of a ""Travelodge amnesty"" - people who have arrived in small boats and are, in UK law, illegal immigrants. They are stuck in limbo in UK hotels at significant expense to the taxpayer. Incidentally, Sir Keir did this while projecting a confidence I've not seen before in him. Not just his manner on stage, but his willingness to praise a Conservative idea - the Small Boats Operational Command - strictly up to a point, which he claims he would build on. And praise a Conservative cabinet minister, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk.It amounted, in the round, I thought, to a man with the air of an heir.A man - after those local election results and the second defection to his party from the Conservatives in a fortnight - who might just feel closer to the prospect of becoming prime minister than ever before. Seven takeaways from the local electionsConservative MP Dan Poulter defects to LabourTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourSir Keir's label of a claimed Conservative ""Travelodge amnesty"" is an attempt to push back at the Tory description of Labour's plan to allow people who have arrived on small boats to apply for asylum.Yes, you guessed it, the Conservatives describe that as an amnesty too. Both leaders clearly see a political value in projecting an aggression on this topic and portraying their opponent as weak, even soft.The big picture here, acknowledged by them both and illustrated in this example, is this is deeply complex and there is no off the shelf panacea on offer. What do you do about the huge backlogs of people? How do you create deterrents to crossing the Channel? Are deterrents even possible? What does fairness and justice look like, to people contemplating a crossing, others seeking a legal route to the UK, and the British taxpayer? Are international legal frameworks, domestic laws, or agreements with other countries up to scale of the challenge?Returning more people not granted asylum to their country of origin is key.BBC Verify has been looking at how this might apply to recent small boat arrivals.Vietnamese people - 1,266 in total - and Afghans - 1,216 people - make up the top two nationalities arriving in the UK this way so far this year.The next most common nationalities to have arrived this way between 1 January and 21 April 2024 were Iranians, Syrians and Eritreans.Of these five countries, the government only has a returns agreement with Vietnam, so ministers in this government or any future one would have to negotiate agreements with the other four if the asylum seekers' claims were rejected.Plus none of them currently feature on the government's list of where people can be safely returned, which poses a further potential challenge.It is for Mr Sunak, Sir Keir and others to win arguments and gain trust on this most difficult, emotional, diplomatic and political of issues - and to grapple for solutions. As partial, long winded and expensive as they may prove to be.Starmer vows to scrap Rwanda scheme 'straight away'What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Conservative PartyKeir StarmerRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakLabour PartyMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68994326"
"29 November 2023","Fact-checking claims about the government's migration policies","Fact-checking claims about the government's migration policies29 November 2023ShareAnthony Reuben, Tamara Kovacevic and Lucy GilderBBC VerifyShareUK Parliament/Jessica TaylorThe government has been defending its immigration policies after the release of high migration figures and the Supreme Court's ruling against its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. We've looked at some of the claims being made.'Recent estimates of immigration show that it's slowing' - Rishi SunakSpeaking at prime minister's questions, Mr Sunak was referring to official migration figures released on 23 November.They show net migration of 672,000 people for the year to the end of June 2023.That figure was up from 607,000 for the year to the end of June 2022, but down from 745,000 for the whole of 2022.Net migration is the number of people arriving in the UK who plan to stay for at least a year, minus the people leaving for at least a year.The Office for National Statistics, which released the figures, said ""while it is too early to say if this is the start of a new downward trend, these more recent estimates indicate a slowing of immigration"".The figure is nonetheless at a historically high level - Mr Sunak has described it as ""far too high"".The Conservatives' manifesto in 2019 promised that ""overall numbers will come down"". In the year that pledge was made, net migration ended up at 184,000.UK net migration in 2022 revised up to record 745,000'[Labour's plan is] a cosy deal with the EU, which would see the UK accept 100,000 illegal migrants' - Rishi SunakRishi Sunak criticised the Labour leader's plan to stop small boats coming to the UK.Keir Starmer has said he would negotiate a returns agreement with EU countries to send back some failed asylum seekers - if Labour wins power.Mr Sunak's claim is based on an assumption that Labour would have to take 13% of all asylum seekers arriving in the EU as part of such an agreement.The Conservatives have said this is because the EU has a policy of sharing asylum seekers between countries based on population size. They say this would mean the UK taking over 100,000 of them a year.But although the EU has been discussing for years how to share responsibility for refugees, no deal based on population is in place.Labour has said it would not - and could not - sign up to an EU quota scheme because the UK is not a member state, so any agreement would have to be outside that.PA Media'The number of crossings is down by a third' - Rishi SunakThe prime minister was talking about small boat crossings. He's made ""stopping the boats"" one of his five key pledges in government, which we've been tracking. As at 13 November, 27,284 people had been detected crossing the English Channel in 2023, according to the Home Office.At the same point in 2022, almost 42,000 people had been detected, so the number crossing is indeed down by a third.'The government has never succeeded in actually getting a successor to what was known as the Dublin III agreement, which meant that people here with no right to be here could then be removed' - Nick Thomas-SymondsMr Thomas-Symonds - a Labour MP - was speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live after the Supreme Court's judgement on 15 November.He was referring to an EU scheme - Dublin III - which allows member states to return failed asylum seekers to other EU countries, taking into consideration factors such as family reunion and irregular entry.The scheme ended in the UK after Brexit in January 2021.But Home Office data shows the numbers involved were pretty small and actually more people ended up coming to the UK under this scheme than were removed in the final six years it was operating in the UK.From 2015 to end of 2020, 3,961 people were transferred to the UK and only 1,763 were removed under the scheme.PA Media'The UNHCR processes Libyan refugees in Rwanda' - Jacob Rees-MoggMr Rees-Mogg defended the government's Rwanda scheme on BBC Question Time on 23 November.Supreme Court rules Rwanda asylum policy unlawfulHe said that the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) processes refugees in Rwanda. He argued the government's plan was ""not that outrageous a thing to do, otherwise the UNHCR, which doesn't want the UK to do it, wouldn't be doing it itself"".It is true that the UNHCR, with financial support from the EU, has transferred refugees from Libya to Rwanda under a scheme called the Emergency Transit Mechanism (ETM).However, the ETM is voluntary, not compulsory, like the UK's plan. The ETM offers vulnerable refugees, taken into detention by the Libyan authorities, a choice to have their application processed in Rwanda.Libya - a major transit route for those hoping to reach Europe - is not considered a safe country for refugees.People moved from Libya to Rwanda by the UNHCR are given assistance to resettle elsewhere should they choose to do so. It says that ""as of March 2023, 932 refugees from the ETM centre have been resettled to Canada, Sweden, Norway, Finland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and USA"".'Some 20,000 people have been returned this year' - Rishi SunakThe prime minister was talking about the number of people who have been returned to other countries from the UK.Mr Sunak did not make clear what type of return he was referring to, but the combination of voluntary and enforced returns this year does add up to about 20,000. The latest data shows that 5,095 people were forcibly removed from the UK between January and October 2023. A further 15,204 left the country voluntarily in the same period. About a fifth of the 20,299 people returned so far in 2023 were Albanians. Not all of the 20,000 people returned were failed asylum seekers - some of them were foreign national offenders.What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?Refugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakPrime Minister's QuestionsBBC Verify","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67431602"
"15 September 2023","Row over Labour's small boats plan deepens","Row over Labour's small boats plan deepens15 September 2023ShareShareGetty ImagesLabour has defended its proposals to tackle the small boats crisis - after the government accused it of pursuing an ""open border policy"". Sir Keir Starmer has said he would aim to negotiate a returns agreement with EU countries to send back some failed asylum seekers if Labour wins power. Government ministers claim the policy would lead to 100,000 illegal migrants a year being shipped to the UK.But this was rejected as ""garbage"" by Labour's shadow home secretary.On Thursday, Sir Keir suggested he may be willing to accept a quota of migrants in the UK in exchange for a returns deal, as he set out plans to crack down on international people smuggling gangs.Starmer seeks new EU deal to stop small boats gangsHighest number of migrants cross Channel in 2023How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?This was seized on by the Conservatives as evidence Labour would pursue an ""open border"" migration policy if it won power.Home Office minister Chris Philp told Times Radio: ""I think his policy has no credibility and the British public don't want to see 100,000 of Europe's illegal immigrants being shipped over here under Keir Starmer's open border policy.""Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper rubbished the government's claims in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, arguing that their figures were based on a returns scheme for EU member states.Formally joining the EU quota scheme would not be part of the plan because the UK is not a member state, she said, meaning any agreement would be with individual countries.Ms Cooper told Today: ""We have seen total garbage on this from the Conservatives over the last 24 hours, which just shows how desperate they are that their whole system is failing.""She later explained that Labour's policy would involve ""controlled and managed but safe routes for children who have family in the UK"".Ms Cooper has also been setting out Labour's plans to end the use of hotels, barges and former military bases to house asylum seekers if it wins the next general election.She said Labour would recruit 1,000 new caseworkers to clear the asylum backlog and set up temporary Nightingale Asylum Courts to speed up the decision-making process.Labour is also promising to fast-track decisions on applications from ""safe"" countries, such as Albania and India.The party claims that once the current asylum backlog is clear there will be no need for hotels, barges or former military bases, which Ms Cooper said are costing taxpayers more than £2bn a year.Labour's plans have also come under attack from the left.Matt Wrack, the president of the Trade Union Congress, told the Guardian Sir Keir was in ""danger of pandering to right wing Tory rhetoric"" on immigration.Would the UK take 100,000 migrants a year from the EU under Labour?The Conservatives' claim that Labour would let in 100,000 illegal migrants to the EU every year assumes Sir Keir's party would sign up to taking 13% of all asylum seekers who arrive in the EU.They say this is because the EU has a policy of sharing asylum seekers between countries, based on population size. About one million arrive in the EU each year. The UK's population is just under 13% of the EU's total, so this would mean taking well over 100,000 asylum seekers. However, although the EU has been negotiating for years on how to share responsibility for refugees arriving via the Mediterranean, no deal based on population is in place.In 2015, when refugee numbers peaked in Europe, the UK was still an EU member state, but did not take part in an EU-wide response as it had an opt-out.Labour has now said it would not - and could not - sign up to an EU quota scheme because the UK is not a member state, so any agreement would have to be outside that.

[she's] taken the same decision as so many other former Conservative supporters up and down the country.""I think it's absolutely right she's done so because she's clearly here putting her constituents first.""Mrs Elphicke has said she will not be standing to remain as an MP at the general election and has not been offered a peerage by Labour as a reward for defecting. She will be given an unpaid role advising Labour on housing policy.She has campaigned for rent freezes and against homelessness - areas where she has common ground with Labour.But she has also previously accused Labour of being soft on human rights and migration.Many Labour MPs are deeply uncomfortable with remarks she made about her ex-husband Charlie Elphicke, whom she replaced as Dover MP in 2019.In an interview with the Sun after his conviction in 2020 for sexual assault, she was reported to have said being ""attractive"" and ""attracted to women"" had made him an ""easy target"".She has not commented on those previous remarks since defecting on Wednesday.Labour said: ""all those issues have been dealt with previously both in Parliament and in public.""But Jess Phillips, the former shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, said Mrs Elphicke should ""account for her actions"".The Labour MP told ITV's Peston: ""I'm all for forgiveness but I do think that that needs some explaining.""Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer said on Wednesday he was ""delighted"" with her defection, telling reporters it showed Labour was ""the party of the national interest"". In her defection statement, Mrs Elphicke said Labour had ""changed out of all recognition"" under Keir Starmer and now occupied the ""centre ground"" in British politics.""For me key deciding factors have been housing and the safety and security of our borders,"" she added.0:14Watch: Natalie Elphicke takes seat on Labour benchesIt is the second defection to Labour for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in less than two weeks, after Dr Dan Poulter also quit the Tories last month. Mr Poulter was viewed as more on the centre of the Conservative party, however.Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield said Labour MPs were ""baffled"" by Mrs Elphicke's defection, describing it as ""really peculiar"". She said she did not ""believe for a second that [Mrs Elphicke] has suddenly transformed into a Labour MP"".John McDonnell, who was shadow chancellor under former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, told LBC he was ""surprised and shocked"", adding: ""I'm a great believer in the powers of conversion, but I think even this one would have strained the generosity of spirit of John the Baptist, quite honestly.""Labour backbencher Mick Whitley called the defection ""outrageous,"" adding Mrs Elphicke did not share the ""values of the Labour movement"".Foreign secretary - and former prime minister - Lord Cameron said the defection demonstrated that Labour stood for nothing. He told an audience at the National Cyber Security Centre that when he first heard about it he thought ""Oh no, not another one"".However, he went on to say that ""by the end of the day it was like 'that says so much more about Keir Starmer and the Labour Party having a complete lack of a plan than it does about a prime minister who is a good man doing a great job at a difficult time'.""Other Conservatives expressed surprise with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan labelling Mrs Elphicke's move ""bewildering"" and showing ""a real lack of principles"".""She's very much on the right wing of the party. I know all parties are a broad church, but she was an ERG member and big Liz Truss supporter, I believe,"" she told GB News.Transport Minister Huw Merriman branding her ""shameless"" and an ""opportunist"", adding ""I'm just disappointed for politics that she's done what she's done"".Mish Rahman, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, said that he did not welcome Mrs Elphicke's defection, saying the party is getting ""grubbier"".He said the Labour Party should be in the business of changing the country, ""not saving the careers of Tory politicians who the British public are rejecting because of the damage they've done to the country"".""She's not fit to be a Labour Party member, let alone an MP,"" he added.Do you live in Natalie Elphicke's constituency in Dover?

"27 November 2023","Labour says it 'won't set arbitrary target' on migration","Labour says it 'won't set arbitrary target' on migration27 November 2023ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterShareGetty ImagesLabour's Darren Jones had suggested ""a couple of hundred thousand a year"" would be a normal level for net migrationLabour has said it will not set an ""arbitrary target"" on cutting net migration. It comes after a shadow minister told the BBC the party hoped figures would reach a ""normal level"" of ""a couple of hundred thousand a year"" if it wins the next election. Darren Jones said the numbers would depend on the needs of the economy.A Labour spokesperson said it expected its proposals would lead to a fall in net migration. ""Labour's position hasn't changed. As we have set out we will scrap the 20% wage discount, review the skilled worker salary threshold and reform the Migration Advisory Committee to link it to the bodies setting out industrial and skills strategy,"" the spokesperson said after Mr Jones' BBC interview earlier. ""As a result of these measures we expect net migration will go down, but we won't set an arbitrary target unlike the Tories - who have never come close to meeting it.""The Conservatives are under pressure to cut migration after new figures showed it reached record levels last year. Net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving - was 745,000 last year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, published earlier this week. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has described the figure as ""shockingly high"", while Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also said immigration levels are too high and need to come down ""to sustainable levels"". Labour has said it would increase the salary requirements for foreign workers to come to the UK, based on recommendations from the independent Migration Advisory Committee.Currently the annual salary threshold for a skilled worker visa is set at £26,200 but roles on the shortage occupation list can be offered at £20,960. Labour has said it would scrap this 20% discount if it wins power. Laura Kuenssberg: Questions politicians can't seem to answer on immigrationChris Mason: Brexit means buck stops with government on immigrationBack in 2010, Lord David Cameron, the former Tory prime minister who was appointed foreign secretary in the recent reshuffle, pledged to get net migration below 100,000 - but the commitment has never been met.The Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto also promised to bring overall numbers down, without setting a specific target, after the introduction of post-Brexit border controls.Asked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg what a reasonable level of net migration would be, Mr Jones said: ""The normal level is a couple of hundred thousand a year but it depends on the needs in the economy.""Pressed on whether this would be something Labour would hope to achieve in its first term in government, if the party wins power, Mr Jones said: ""I think we probably would hope to do that, yes, but we've talked about a decade of national renewal.""However, he added that the Conservatives had left ""deep structural problems"" which would ""take time to fix"". Mr Jones suggested the ""abnormally high number of work visas"", particularly for health and social care, reflected issues with the way the NHS was being run by the government. He called for ""a proper NHS workforce plan"" and improvements in productivity so the UK was not so reliant on workers from overseas. The vast majority of those arriving in the UK in the year ending June 2023 were from outside the European Union. Students accounted for the largest group of non-EU migrants, followed by those coming for work. The ONS said this could largely be attributed to people on health and care visas, with the sector facing chronic staff shortages. However, it said provisional figures suggested the rate of net migration could now be slowing, with the estimated number falling back to 672,000 in the year to June. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott said this was ""positive news"" but that the government was taking further steps to cut migration. For example, earlier this year it announced new restrictions on students bringing family members with them to the UK, which come into effect from January. Ms Trott told the BBC the government's long-term plan for the NHS workforce would also mean more people would be trained for jobs in health and social care. Tory MPs on the right of the party, including former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, have been calling for tougher measures to cut migration.Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick has drawn up his own set of proposals, which are not yet government policy but are being discussed internally. These include increasing the minimum salary required for a work visa and introducing a cap on health and social care visas.

"9 May 2024","The inside story of Tory MP's Natalie Elphicke's defection to Labour","The inside story of Tory MP's Natalie Elphicke's defection to Labour9 May 2024ShareHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentShareGetty ImagesBefore Tory MP Christian Wakeford swapped sides to Labour at the peak of the Partygate scandal in 2022, it had been 27 years since an MP had defected directly from the governing party to the main party of opposition.Less than two weeks ago, Dan Poulter made the same journey as Mr Wakeford.And today - to bafflement and shock from MPs of all parties - Natalie Elphicke sits as a Labour MP. Indeed, it took a while for MPs to work out what Sir Keir Starmer was talking about at Prime Minister's Questions when he welcomed Mrs Elphicke to his side; few had noticed her sit down behind the Labour leader.She walked in accompanied by John Healey, the shadow defence secretary - who is understood to have been instrumental to wooing her across, due to a working relationship they forged due to a shared interest in housing. Mrs Elphicke worked in the housing sector before she became an MP in 2019, while Mr Healey was the housing minister in Gordon Brown's government and shadowed the brief for Labour from 2015 to 2020. Follow live: Tory MP defects to Labour at PMQsTory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to LabourWho is Natalie Elphicke, the new Labour MP?Sir Keir and his team are jubilant. They believe there could be few clearer messages for voters motivated by the small boats issue than the MP for Dover - where many of the crossings arrive - declaring that she trusts the Labour leader over Rishi Sunak on the issue. Remember this is one of the prime minister's five priorities: an issue at the heart of his attempts to reverse his political predicament. 0:14Watch: Natalie Elphicke takes seat on Labour benchesMore broadly, Sir Keir's allies believe that the defection will help him make a direct argument to 'big C' Conservatives that if an MP as 'small c' conservative as Mrs Elphicke is moving to Labour, so they should too.On the flipside, that is exactly what is worrying some Labour MPs, who worry that a broad church that can include Mrs Elphicke is simply too broad. Multiple sources claimed that party whips, who are responsible for enforcing discipline, expressed concerns about admitting Mrs Elphicke to the party, though Labour denied this. It is worth remembering, too, that some Labour MPs are still angry that Diane Abbott, first elected as a Labour MP in 1987, has not had the Labour whip restored since April last year, when she was suspended over allegations of antisemitism.Rent freeze callThe two previous Conservative defectors were widely welcomed by Labour MPs: Mr Wakeford was disillusioned with Boris Johnson at a moment when his character was at the heart of the political debate; Labour MPs liked that Mr Poulter defected specifically on the issue of the NHS.Mrs Elphicke's cause of immigration and asylum policy sits less easily with many Labour MPs - though it is worth noting that she also cited housing, where her views are much more in tune with the Labour mainstream. It hasn't helped settle some Labour MPs' nerves that so many Conservative MPs have been noisily declaring that they are much less right-wing than Mrs Elphicke.The truth about Ms Elphicke's position on the ideological spectrum is perhaps a little more nuanced. She was staunchly pro-Brexit, and a member of the Eurosceptic European Research Group of Conservative MPs.Yet while she has repeatedly castigated Labour over its approach to small boats, she has long argued that diplomacy with France will be more effective than the government's Rwanda scheme - putting her fairly close to Labour, which opposes the policy.Rumblings of dissatisfactionIn 2022, she proposed that all private rents be frozen to help renters with the cost of living, and the next year was part of a cross-party project to build houses for homeless people. In February she praised Nye Bevan, one of the heroes of the post-war Labour government, in the House of Commons. Some of the anxieties among Labour MPs are not just about Mrs Elphicke's beliefs, but about her messy arrival in politics. She has only been an MP since 2019, replacing her then-husband, Charlie Elphicke, after he was charged with sexual assault. He was later convicted and imprisoned, at which point she announced that their marriage was ending. Despite the private rumblings of dissatisfaction from some quarters of the Labour Party, it is noteworthy that few have so far gone public to express their concerns. That is a sign of a disciplined Labour Party, with even some of the MPs most sceptical about Sir Keir's leadership determined not to make victory at the general election harder by sounding off. But that does not mean they will forget this episode. One Labour figure warned that Sir Keir was ""storing up bad will"" for the government that most people - including Natalie Elphicke - now assume he will lead.

The pledge was included in a previous version of the Brexit bill, but was removed after the Tories' election win.The government said it had ""a proud record of helping vulnerable children.""MPs voted on the Labour amendment during a second day of scrutiny of the Brexit bill - or EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill as it is officially known. That's the legislation implementing Boris Johnson's Brexit deal and it must be passed by both the Commons and Lords if the UK is to leave the EU on 31 January - the current deadline.  EU 'must avoid lost generation' of young refugees MPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit billWhat is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?Labour's Lord Dubs - who came to the UK as a child to escape the Nazis - had campaigned for the commitment to be included in the bill.It was included in Theresa May's Brexit bill, but was removed in Boris Johnson's version, something he called ""appalling and deeply distressing"".The newly-worded bill replaced the commitment to negotiate with the EU a continuation of the rights of child refugees with a reduced obligation to make statements to Parliament on the government's child refugee policy after Brexit.What did Labour ask for?In the Commons, shadow Brexit minister Thangam Debbonaire made the case for the Labour amendment, arguing that removing it from the bill was an ""astonishing breach of faith with some of the most vulnerable children in the world"".Backing its return was ""about who we want to be as a country"".""It is deeply wrong for the government to seek to remove this provision... just because they can,"" she went on.""Family reunion should not need explaining, but it appears it does. Families belong together.""Getty ImagesLord Dubs came to the UK on the Kindertransport aged six and later became a Labour MPLord Dubs and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer earlier wrote to Conservative MPs urging them to support Labour's amendment to reinstate the pledge.They said: ""We know that there are many Conservative MPs, including some sat around the cabinet table, who know that this decision was wrong.""Boris Johnson may have won a majority in Parliament, but he did not win the moral argument to absolve himself of responsibility to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.""With the numbers in Parliament being what they are, it's up to you - Conservative MPs - to take a moral stance and force the government to rethink its approach on this vital issue.""The Liberal Democrats have also called for the government to rethink what they call an ""inhumane"" position.How did the government respond?Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker told MPs the government was ""fully committed"" to the principle of family reunion and its policy ""has not changed"".However, they will not be backing the amendment to see it guaranteed in law.Mr Walker said the policy of reuniting families would continue during the transition period while a deal is being negotiated with the EU on the future trading relationship with the UK.He said Home Secretary Priti Patel had written to the European Commission in October to start negotiations on what would happen after that period's end in December 2020.""We give very strong support for the principle of family reunion,"" Mr Walker added.""But the right place to do that is not in this legislation and we do not need further reporting requirements or legally binding negotiating objectives, as these amendments set out.""What is happening with Brexit this week?MPs gave their initial approval for Boris Johnson's Brexit bill in December, but it is now undergoing more detailed Commons scrutiny.  The bill covers ""divorce"" payments to the EU, citizens' rights, customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the proposed 11-month transition period lasting from 1 February to 31 December.The bill is expected to comfortably pass its remaining stages in the Commons by Thursday before moving to the Lords.Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said the bill would deliver on the ""overwhelming mandate"" his party had been given by the voters to take the UK out of the EU on 31 January.While shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield said Labour accepted their opponents' decisive election victory had changed the political landscape he said he still believed this was a ""bad deal"" for the UK and urged the government to proceed ""with caution"".EU 'must avoid lost generation' of young refugeesMPs resume scrutiny of PM's Brexit billWhat is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51028024"

This could threaten Downing Street's ambition of getting the first flights to the east African country off the ground before June. What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda saga won't be over even when law is passedUK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum dealThe proposed law aims to ensure the UK can deport asylum seekers to Rwanda by declaring it to be a safe place, after the Supreme Court ruled last year it could lead to human rights breaches.Earlier this month, peers added changes to the bill to make it easier for judges to challenge this, and ensure the treaty underpinning deportations is ""fully implemented"" before flights take off.These were rejected in a series of votes on Monday evening, with government majorities ranging from 57 to 78.The bill will now return to the Lords on Wednesday in a process known as ""ping pong,"" where MPs and peers will try and agree the final wording, as the bill is batted between the two Parliamentary chambers.Labour has suggested its peers will not seek to block the bill's passage into law completely. However, the party will order them to try again to reinsert amendments designed to prevent flights taking off until the UK has more assurances that Rwanda is a safe country.If they fail, the bill could become law by the end of this week. But if they succeed, the bill would have to return to the Commons once again.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesperson urged peers to ""work with the government"" at the votes on Wednesday to help ""end the business of people smuggling"".'Frustrate and delay'Another vote would probably have to wait until MPs return from their Easter break on April 15, potentially delaying any flights by several weeks, unless the government clears the Commons schedule to allow votes next week.Labour says each deportation will cost as much as sending six people to space.Michael Tomlinson, Home Office minister, told the Commons on Monday that the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill was ""an essential element"" of protecting the UK's borders.He said that the bill did not conflict with the government's international obligations.Mr Tomlinson also criticised ""systematic legal challenges"" that he said continued to ""frustrate and delay"" removals.ReutersLegal challenges meant the first Rwanda flight was cancelled shortly before take-off in June 2022During the votes on Monday, Labour's Stephen Kinnock supported all the Lords amendments to the bill and said peers were fulfilling their ""patriotic duty"" by scrutinising the draft laws.The shadow Home Office minister said the government must have ""due regard"" for the Supreme Court ruling and claimed Conservative MPs were pushing through ""absurd legislation"" that is ""frankly turning our institutions into a laughing stock"".Labour backbencher Neil Coyle asked whether Mr Tomlinson was aware of the National Audit Office findings showing that the scheme could cost taxpayers nearly £2m for each of the first 300 asylum seekers sent to Rwanda.""Is the minister aware that Virgin Galactic can send six people into space for less than this government wants to spend sending one person to Rwanda?"" he said.""Is it not time to rethink this absurd policy and extortionate cost?""A Virgin Galactic flight to the edge of space for six people was costed at £2.14m last summer.Tory backbencher Richard Graham replied that critics of the cost ""entirely miss the point"" that it would act as a ""huge disincentive"" to those wishing to enter the UK without genuine reason.However Robert Buckland, a former justice secretary, was one of a few Conservative rebels to support some of the Lords' amendments, saying he was concerned about ""creating legal friction"" over whether Rwanda was and continued to be a safe destination.Sir Robert was also keen to stress his support for an amendment exempting those who had helped the UK's armed forces, such as Afghan translators, from deportation to Rwanda. He said: ""I would expect the government to be very sensible and sensitive to the position of Afghan refugees and future refugees and not put them into this scheme, it does seem to me to lose nothing by adding this particular insertion.""£63,000 more to remove a migrant than keep in UKPeers continue scrutiny of Rwanda billLords inflict more defeats on Rwanda billRwanda plan flawed at core says cross-party reportRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68599308"

""He doesn't want to stop the boats, he wants to welcome more of them,"" Mr Sunak said.Tory uproarWhen he first took office last year, Mr Sunak said ""stopping the boats"" would be one of five key priorities for his government ahead of the next general election.More than 45,700 people crossed the Channel to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.As of this month, the number of small boat crossings in 2023 was a third lower than at the same point the year before.The Supreme Court's ruling represents a serious setback for Mr Sunak's asylum policy, and has infuriated Tory MPs who have been critical of his leadership.The ruling came the day after the sacked Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, released an incendiary letter accusing the prime minister of breaking promises over immigration.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mrs Braverman said the government ""must introduce emergency legislation"".She said ""there is no chance of curbing illegal migration within the current legal framework"", adding ""we must legislate or admit defeat"".And Mr Sunak is facing calls from Mrs Braverman's allies on the Tory right to withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), an international treaty.But the Supreme Court made it clear in its judgment that domestic law, as well as international treaties, were relevant to the court's decision.Watch: Starmer quizzes PM on 'magical thinking' on small boatsConservative Party deputy chairman Lee Anderson said the government should ""ignore the laws"" and send migrants back the same day they arrive in the UK.Former Levelling Up Secretary, Sir Simon Clarke, has called for emergency legislation within ""days certainly not more than weeks"" to push forward with the Rwanda scheme.And Sir John Hayes, a close ally of Mrs Braverman, told the BBC that the former home secretary spoke for the ""vast majority of law-abiding Britons"" in saying ""it's just not right"" that the UK cannot get rid of people who enter the country illegally.Conservative MP for Dover Natalie Elphicke said new Foreign Secretary David Cameron should get ""a fast ferry to France"", take advantage of his ""long-standing relationship"" with President Emmanuel Macron and negotiate a new deal to stop boats leaving the French coast.

"31 October 2023","Andy McDonald: Labour suspends MP after speech at pro-Palestinian rally","Andy McDonald: Labour suspends MP after speech at pro-Palestinian rally31 October 2023ShareShareGetty ImagesAndy McDonald has been suspended as a Labour MP, after the party said he had made ""deeply offensive"" comments relating to the Israel-Gaza war. The MP for Middlesbrough used the phrase ""between the river and the sea"" in a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally. Critics of a chant which contains the phrase argue it implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel.But Mr McDonald said his words were intended as ""a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings"" in the region. He will now sit as an independent MP, pending an investigation.In his speech at a demonstration on Saturday, Mr McDonald, a former shadow minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: ""We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.""The phrase ""from the river to the sea"" refers to the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean, and features in a chant which has been heard at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.Earlier this month, Home Secretary Suella Braverman urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the chant as an ""expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world"". Israel and most Jewish groups agree.This interpretation is disputed by some pro-Palestinian activists who say that most people chanting it are calling for an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and blockade of Gaza, not the destruction of Israel itself.  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman has said the phrase is ""a deeply offensive chant to many.""Mr McDonald said he was ""saddened"" by his suspension and believed it would be overturned after he explained his views to the party's investigation. In a statement, he said there had been ""a number of misrepresentations of my words in the media"", which had ""furthered baseless and extremely harmful accusations against me"".He added that his words ""should not be construed in any other way than they were intended, namely as a heartfelt plea for an end to the killings in Israel, Gaza, and the occupied West Bank, and for all peoples in the region to live in freedom without the threat of violence"".Labour divisions deepen over Gaza ceasefire stanceMinisterial aide sacked after call for ceasefireA Labour spokesperson said Mr McDonald's comments at the weekend ""were deeply offensive, particularly at a time of rising antisemitism which has left Jewish people fearful for their safety"".""The chief whip has suspended the Labour whip from Andy McDonald, pending an investigation,"" the spokesperson said.Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the suspension was ""unjust"" and ""absolutely nonsensical"". ""He turned a slogan some are concerned about into a peace plea,"" Mr McDonnell added. Momentum, a left-wing Labour campaign group, branded Mr McDonald's suspension ""an appalling and opportunistic attempt from the Starmer leadership to silence those speaking out in solidarity with Palestine"".The Labour Muslim Network described the suspension as ""obscene and deeply offensive"". ""The fundamental right to live in peace, with liberty and self determination is one which should be applied to all peoples,"" the group said in a statement.""The only conclusion that can be drawn is that those who have made this decision do not see Palestinian and Muslim life as deserving of this fundamental principle.""More on Israel-Gaza warFollow live: Latest updatesWatch: Video said to show Al-Quds hospital after nearby blastIsrael: Could ground invasion of Gaza meet its aims?Explained: What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?History behind the story: The Israel-Palestinian conflictMr McDonald's suspension follows days of internal Labour tensions over the party's position on the Israel-Gaza war.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has not called for a ceasefire, instead backing humanitarian pauses to help aid reach Gaza.In stopping short of backing a full ceasefire, the Labour leader is aligned with the UK government, as well as the US and EU.But dozens of Labour councillors, and senior figures including mayors Sadiq Khan and Andy Burnham, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, and some frontbenchers, have called for a formal ceasefire.The Conservatives have had their own party discipline issues over the Israel-Gaza war, with a ministerial aide earlier being sacked from his government role after calling for a ceasefire.Earlier, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference his country ""will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas"".""Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas,"" Mr Netanyahu said.Meanwhile, the home secretary has described those who have joined protests in support of Palestine as taking part in ""hate marches"".

"9 January 2024","Labour aims to force ministers to publish Rwanda documents","Labour aims to force ministers to publish Rwanda documents9 January 2024ShareHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentSharePA MediaLabour wants ministers to reveal cash given and set to be given to the East African countryLabour will try to force the government to publish a string of documents relating to its Rwanda policy.The party will table a vote on Tuesday demanding ministers disclose how much it would cost to send each asylum seeker to Rwanda.The vote also demands ministers reveal cash given and set to be given to the East African country.In addition, Labour wants to see the full memorandum of understanding ministers reached with Rwanda.The scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda was first announced by Boris Johnson in April 2022. The plan has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far. MPs will further consider the government's legislation which aims to revive the policy next week.Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Sir Keir Starmer's party also want the government to publish papers revealed by the BBC which suggest Rishi Sunak had initially wanted to scale back the scheme when he was chancellor in 2022. Those documents were prepared in No 10 when Boris Johnson was trying to persuade Mr Sunak to sign off on the plan.On Sunday Mr Sunak denied ever doubting the policy would work, saying it was his job as chancellor to ask ""tough questions"" about the cost of every policy that crossed his desk. He said it was ""wrong"" to suggest that he did not ""believe in the scheme"". Labour wants to force the vote on Tuesday afternoon as part of an opposition day, which allows the party to choose a subject for debate. The vote will take the form of a Humble Address - which technically means parliament is asking the King to compel the release of the documents, making the vote binding on the government. The opposition are optimistic that some Conservative MPs will back the motion - although it would be extremely unusual for the government to suffer a large enough rebellion to lose the vote. Tuesday's parliamentary gambit will force a Home Office minister to come to the Commons to justify the government's position on Rwanda before the next phase of parliamentary debates and votes on the Safety of Rwanda Bill, which would state that Rwanda should be considered a safe country under British law along with other provisions designed to put the policy on a stronger legal footing. The bill is expected to return to the Commons this month, most likely next week, with several factions of the Conservative Party uneasy about the plans - some fearing they may go too far, others believing they do not go far enough. Speaking at an event in Accrington on Monday, the prime minister said he would welcome ""bright ideas"" on how to improve the bill, but insisted ""my entire party is supportive"" of the legislation. He said: ""If people have bright ideas about how we can make this more effective whilst complying with our international obligations and retaining Rwanda's participation in the scheme… then of course, I'm open to having those discussions.""Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told the BBC: ""It is totally unacceptable that the Conservatives have refused to come clean on the full costs of the failing Rwanda scheme. ""So far, costs are apparently rising to £400m of taxpayers' money with more home secretaries than asylum seekers sent to Kigali. ""The Conservatives should stop dragging out this chaos and come clean about the real costs and problems.""A government source said: ""We have already declared £240m that has been paid in our partnership agreement with the Rwandan government and one payment of £50m to come in April. ""After that the shadow home secretary's figures are her guesswork and for commercial sensitivity reasons we have not outlined any other potential payments that are all predicated on getting flights to Rwanda, which we are determined to do to stop the boats.""The source added: ""Labour don't like our plans, but really don't have anything at all to offer that would realistically tackle this now-global challenge of illegal migration.""Sunak denies doubting Rwanda plan when chancellorSunak had doubts over Rwanda plan, papers suggestWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?UK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67919190"

""So what everyone should do is support this bill.""Confidence matterWith some Tory MPs in open revolt over the direction of the policy, Mr Sunak is facing questions over whether he can win a vote to support the passage of the bill in Parliament.A government can designate a key vote as a confidence matter. This is a means of putting pressure on MPs to vote with the government on a specific issue.It is a high-risk tactic, as the loss of such a confidence vote can trigger a general election. But Mr Sunak indicated he would not play this card.At the news conference, Mr Sunak was asked if he was telling Tory MPs to ""back me or sack me"", a phrase used by former Tory Prime Minister John Major when he faced a leadership challenge in 1995.Mr Sunak did not answer the question directly but said his ""patience with this has worn thin"".""We've got to end the legal merry-go-round that has blocked us from getting our Rwanda scheme up and running,"" he said.Mr Sunak said ""the real question is for the Labour Party"", which has pledged to scrap the Rwanda policy if it wins the next election, casting doubt over its long-term future.The prime minister said: ""The question is for everyone else, and crucially the Labour Party, what's their plan? They are going to vote for this legislation?""The goading of Labour, and the impromptu news conference, suggests the prime minister has realised the political danger that lies ahead for his government.There are some suggestions Conservative MPs might try to trigger a party confidence vote in Mr Sunak's leadership.Some other Conservatives believe the party's unruliness might compel Mr Sunak to call a general election earlier than expected.The prime minister's press conference does not seem to have done much to calm tensions in his party.A group of Tory right-wingers are taking legal advice on the bill before deciding whether to back it, or move against it next week.The One Nation group of Tory MPs, seen as moderate, have also employed a lawyer to examine the legislation.The task of steering the bill through Parliament falls to Michael Tomlinson, who was appointed illegal migration minister on Thursday.He will work alongside Tom Pursglove, the minister for legal migration, after the prime minister split Mr Jenrick's vacant role in two.Braverman: Tories face oblivion if Rwanda bill failsRobert Jenrick resigns over Rwanda migrant billCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Conservative PartyRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67649447"

Too serious? Too left wing? Too right wing? Too much of a mystery still? For a long time, Keir Starmer's Labour has been miles ahead in the opinion polls. And even before that, for a very long time, he has faced calls to be more explicit about his priorities. When he ran to become leader, promising ""moral socialism"", I wondered what his priorities were as he did his first interview as part of his campaign to take on the job. Even then, he carefully refused to say if his politics were closer to Jeremy Corbyn's or Tony Blair's. This week though, and this weekend at a left wing love-in in Canada with like minded leaders, Keir Starmer is very deliberately picking a subject and sticking to it, talking about border security and immigration.  This episode illustrates exactly the opportunity and dilemma the Labour leadership faces. Say too much? The plans can be shredded (or nabbed!) by opponents, or cause grumbles closer to home. Say as little as humanly possible, and face accusations that you stand for nothing, and have no ideas of your own. PA MediaYvette Cooper and Keir Starmer aiming to show they mean business on migrationAfter attacks on the border security plans presented alongside Keir Starmer's carefully-choreographed trip to Europol, in the Netherlands, is Labour damned if they dare put policy out there, and damned if they don't? The plans, which you can read more about here, were met with what could have almost been a pre-scripted response. There were squeals from the right immediately, with highly debatable claims that the Labour would automatically open the door to an extra 100,000 migrants a year. That estimate assumed that a Labour government would sign up to an EU-wide quota deal that is not yet in operation. Labour says they would never sign up to the continent-wide scheme, even though they do want closer cooperation. Labour blueprint says tough spending rules 'non-negotiable'Row over Labour's small boats plan deepensKeir Starmer: Labour leader hoping for keys to No10Some Conservatives reckon Starmer has made a ""strategic mistake"" by focusing on these plans, opening himself to accusations of cosying up to the EU on immigration. But one shadow minister played down the attack, saying the ""Tories are struggling and so it means they are going to make stuff up"". On the other side, there was some obvious discomfort too at the message the leadership has been pushing. Union leaders and charity bosses branded it as ""pandering"", ""knee-jerk"" language just to grab ""headlines in the Sun"". Certainly, promises to ""smash the gangs"", or treat human traffickers like ""terrorists"" are not designed to tickle the bellies of the Labour membership - those who'll be leafing through all 116 pages of the party's policy document, which will be argued over and voted on at conference in a few weeks. On this week's show are Foreign Secretary James Cleverly and Labour's shadow cabinet office minister and national campaigns coordinator Pat McFadden.Watch live on BBC One and iPlayer from 09:00 BST on SundayFollow latest updates in text and video on the BBC News website from 08:00So if Starmer's had screams from the right and squeals from the left, then surely something's gone wrong? Not so fast. It's politics! Not normal life. It's a weird old business. You pick an issue, provoke a row. The row isn't a damaging thing, as long as it stays as a controllable spat, not an overwhelming bunfight. The row is, in fact, the point. Get your rivals on the inside and the outside to argue, the argument kicks off, then get the public to notice you are taking a stand on issues they care about, and bingo. The impression is created, whether it's genuine or not, that the party understands voters' worries and will actually do something about it. As one Labour source suggests, ""in opposition you have to be prepared to have the row, that's the only way you get heard"".They say, ""whether we are trying to claim the mantle of the economy, or the party to fix small boats - we have to show we can make progress on it"". That doesn't happen by shying away from a tricky subject, or only sticking to Labour crowd pleasers.Credibility by caring about the right things and offering solutions is the aim. A shadow cabinet minister says the proposals are about being ""practical"", the political responses this week were predictable, and the priority is to ""look like they are serious"" about fixing the country's ills. PA MediaMore than 100,000 migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats in the last five yearsLabour HQ seems neither surprised nor perturbed by the rumpus their proposals this week caused. Proposals out there - tick. Attention grabbed - tick. More images and coverage of Keir Starmer to come on his adventure to Canada and Paris - tick.  But there are, of course, still risks all around. There is a sense among some voters that Labour still just attacks on issues where things are going wrong for the Conservatives, like immigration, rather than pursuing strong areas of their own. One pollster says in almost every focus group they host, someone says of Starmer, ""he just criticises"" - the ""risk is [the] public just think Keir is a moaner or a clever lawyer"". There is a danger, they say, ""of Labour not having their agenda"", so even if they win, ""if things improve people don't stick with them, or potentially worse they have zero honeymoon when they get in, and no enthusiasm"". There is also a risk of stirring up too much unhappiness on the left, so that the party ends up preoccupied with internal fights again. It is not true to say that this is the first time Labour has talked about immigration, or that the party has always avoided the topic.Labour PartyEd Miliband's 2015 campaign mug did not go down well with activistsRemember Gordon Brown's clamour for ""British jobs for British workers"" or Ed Miliband's awkward somersaults over the issue, accompanied by his bizarre branded mug which promised controls on immigration?But Keir Starmer's trying to show something else - not just that he will talk about the issue, but that the party is comfortable taking on the concern and has credible solutions. There are dangers for any opposition in saying too little or too much. The thing Labour is most afraid of is not winning or losing any specific argument, but failing to win the country, and losing again.

'Hands are tied'Another amendment backed by peers says that flights should not take off until a committee of experts set up to monitor the scheme decides Rwanda has fulfilled certain safeguards.This one, moved by crossbench, or independent, peer Baron Hope of Craighead, who said he ""very much"" regretted having to request changes again, passed by 245 to 208He said confirmation Rwanda's treaty with the UK had been implemented, and continued to be, was needed ""before we can make the judgement that Rwanda can be considered safe"".""It's certainly not my intention to obstruct the operation of the bill in any way,"" he added. ""The amendment I'm proposing is necessary to make sense of the bill - it's modest and simple and easy to operate.""He was backed by Baroness Chakrabati who said it was a ""parliamentary sovereignty amendment"" allowing the secretary of state to make a judgement call.Labour does not have a majority in the Lords but crossbench peers are continuing their opposition.Responding to the votes, Home Secretary James Cleverly blamed Labour for the government's defeats.""Terrified that the Rwanda scheme will work, and desperate to delay or disrupt over a hundred votes about stopping the boats, Labour have acted again to block the passage of the Rwanda Bill,"" he said.""It's been another politically cynical effort by them, who have no alternative deterrent and no plan to tackle illegal migration, to frustrate the only solution on offer.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made the scheme a key part of his plan to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats.

The government introduced the bill last month, after its plan to send asylum seekers to the east African country was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send refugees to - thereby stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds.Ministers could ignore emergency orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to suspend a flight to Rwanda while an individual legal case was being heard. But rebels insist it will still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed. They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore injunctions from the ECHR blocking flights.'Win the argument'The amendments are destined to fail at the vote next Tuesday as they will struggle to attract the required support from Labour MPs to overturn the government's majority. However, the rebels could put the government's bill in jeopardy if they vote it down at a later stage if it remains unamended.A group of 29 MPs would be big enough to overturn Mr Sunak's 56-seat majority, if they were to vote with Labour, which opposes the Rwanda policy.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Jenrick did not rule out voting the whole bill down if their proposed changes were not successful.However, he added he was ""not looking ahead to that"" and the rebels were hoping to ""win the argument"".He said the current version of the bill was ""guaranteed to fail"" because it would not provide a ""sustainable deterrent"" to people crossing the Channel to claim asylum.He added that appeals to deportations should only be allowed in a limited number of cases, such as for women who are pregnant and those unfit to fly.Tory rebels had threatened to vote against the bill before Christmas - but in the end they only abstained, meaning passed its initial parliamentary stage fairly comfortably.One Nation pressureMinisters could make concessions to the rebels in order to win them round, but it is thought this is unlikely to happen until the bill reaches its final stages in Parliament.And the government is also facing pressure from Tory MPs on the more liberal One Nation wing of the party, who insist the bill cannot be tightened further without breaching international law.The Rwandan government has also threatened to pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations. Downing Street said Mr Sunak would consider amendments put forward by Tory MPs, and ""engagements"" were taking place with backbenchers. However, his spokesperson told reporters the government would not accept any changes that could ""jeopardise"" the UK's deal with Rwanda.""We need a bill with a respectable legal argument and one which does not collapse the scheme,"" they added.Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Rwanda bill overrides some human rights lawLabour aims to force Rwanda documents publicationSunak’s Rwanda law at mercy of Tory factionsRobert JenrickRishi SunakRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67930783"

In an interview on LBC radio last week, Sir Keir said Israel had the ""right to defend herself"" after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched unprecedented attack on 7 October that killed 1,400 people.He added that this included ""everything it can"" to get hostages taken into Gaza home ""safe and sound"".Councillor leaves Labour over Starmer's commentsPM urged to back Israel and Gaza ceasefire callPressed on whether cutting off water and power supplies into Gaza would be appropriate as part of an Israeli response, he replied: ""I think that Israel does have that right, it is an ongoing situation.""Obviously, everything should be done within international law, but I don't want to step away from the core principles that Israel has a right to defend herself"".Some Labour councillors quit the party over Sir Keir's comments, which they argue amounted to an endorsement of the collective punishment of Palestinian people, against international law.But Sir Keir's spokesman sought to defuse the row on Wednesday - a week after the interview was broadcast - by suggesting the Labour leader had only meant to say Israel had a general right to self-defence.So far, about a dozen Labour councillors - out of more than 6,000 - are reported to have resigned over Sir Keir's stance. Two of them, Shaista Aziz and Amar Latif, who sit on Oxford City Council, said Sir Keir's remarks seemed ""to condone the use of collective punishment against the people of Gaza in direct contravention of international law"".They added they had sought ""urgent clarification"" from national and local leadership but had not heard back, they wrote in their resignation statement last week.

In the letter, first reported by the New Statesman, Sir Keir said there should be ""humanitarian corridors and humanitarian access, including food, water, electricity and medicines"" to people in Gaza - as well as protection for aid workers.Video call ""Labour has been clear; Israel has the right to defend herself; to keep its people safe and bring hostages home,"" he wrote, adding this must be ""conducted in accordance with international law"".It comes after Sir Keir's chief of staff Sue Gray and David Lammy, Labour's shadow foreign secretary, held a video call on Monday evening to discuss the party's response.Sources said the call was an opportunity for councillors to ""air their views"" - but the party would not be changing its position as a result of the meeting.Some on the left of the party have joined the SNP in calling on Sir Keir, as well as the government, to back a ceasefire to protect civilians.

"16 April 2024","MPs reject Lords amendments to Rwanda bill","MPs reject Lords amendments to Rwanda bill16 April 2024ShareNick Eardley, political correspondent & James Gregory & Chris Mason, political editorBBC NewsShareEPAThe Rwanda scheme was designed as a deterrent to small boat crossingsMPs have rejected all changes to the Rwanda bill made in the House of Lords in an ongoing parliamentary stand-off.The much-debated bill will now return to the upper chamber for further scrutiny on Tuesday. It comes as reports suggest the UK held talks with other countries, including Armenia, about replicating the scheme. The plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda has faced setbacks since it was first announced in April 2022 by Boris Johnson's government. The bill, which declares Rwanda safe, is likely to pass this week - with the government majority meaning any further amendments made by peers should be overturned.It will not become law until both Commons and Lords agree on the final wording, a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.It will now returns to the Lords, where peers are set to review it on Tuesday - possibly making additional changes that could extend the parliamentary disputes. In the vote on Monday, MPs rejected six amendments, one of which would have granted a removal exemption for people who had supported the UK's armed forces overseas. The government also rejected calls to exempt victims of modern slavery from the Rwanda scheme, instead proposing its own amendment that would provide an annual report on the impact of the policy on victims, which then passed. Chris Mason: Government hopes are high for Rwanda plan approvalWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Charities plan legal action against Rwanda removalsAs reported in the Times, internal government documents show Costa Rica, Ivory Coast and Armenia have been considered as options for similar schemes, if Rwanda proves successful.The BBC has seen some of the documents, which are from several months ago, and understands the list is accurate.The early stage plans are described by sources as in a ""holding pattern"", with other countries keen to see if the Rwanda plan actually gets going before trying anything similar themselves. Other African nations, including Morocco, Tunisia, Namibia and Gambia, ""explicitly declined"" to enter technical discussions, according to the Times.Sir Matthew Rycroft, the top civil servant at the Home Office said the document was ""out of date"" and it should not be assumed there are active negotiations with other countries. He told the Commons Public Accounts Committee the Foreign Office had assessed a lot of countries but only ""a tiny number"" had progressed to the next stage.A government spokesperson said the UK ""is continuing to work with a range of international partners to tackle global illegal migration challenges"" but its current focus was on passing the Rwanda bill and putting plans in place to get flights off the ground as soon as possible. 'Doomed to fail'Labour believes the scheme is flawed and intends to scrap it if it wins the general election, expected to be held later this year. Shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the Rwanda scheme is ""doomed to fail"" calling it ""fundamentally unworkable, unaffordable and unlawful"".Sir Keir Starmer has said he would instead focus on targeting criminal gangs and negotiating new security arrangements with Europe.Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Kinnock said he hoped the Conservatives ""will come to understand that hard graft and common sense are always more effective than the sugar rush of a tabloid front page"".Meanwhile, charities supporting asylum seekers are also planning to launch legal challenges ""as quickly as possible"" against deporting people to the east-central African country if the bill becomes law this week.Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti said the Lords amendments sought to improve the bill and did not attack ""the central plank of the policy"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her own amendment would restore ""the jurisdiction of domestic courts, who are defenestrated by this bill"". However, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes said legal appeals had been used to block deportations and ""frustrate"" the will of Parliament and government policy. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly said flights to Rwanda would take off by spring, but refused to name a specific date. Ministers believe the legislation will pave the way for the first removals to the country within weeks. The Safety of Rwanda Bill declares the country safe and was introduced to Parliament after the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the government's scheme was unlawful.In its ruling, the court said genuine refugees being deported there would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm. The Rwanda scheme was originally introduced by then-Prime Minister Mr Johnson in April 2022 with the aim of acting as a deterrent to people from arriving in the UK on small boats across the English Channel.It has faced a number of legal challenges since, and so far no-one has been sent to the east African country under the scheme.The bill aims to protect the scheme from further legal setbacks.It comes as 534 migrants crossed the Channel in 10 boats on Sunday - the highest daily figure this year. It brings the total for 2024 so far to 6,265, an increase of 28% on the same period last year.

The government has not given its backing to Mr MacNeil's private member's bill but it passed its second reading after Labour, Lib Dem and some Tory MPs spoke in favour of it, as well as the SNP.Labour 'to end deportation heartbreak'UK to end Dubs child migrant promiseGovernment sees off child migrant challengeSpeaking after MPs backed the principle of the bill by 129 votes to 42, Mr MacNeil said it was a simple fact that bringing families together helped them flourish and benefited society as a whole. ""It's clear that this issue isn't about party politics, it's about doing the right thing,"" he said. ""It was pretty obvious to all of us that families belong together and that children belong with their parents. I hope that ministers come to the same compassionate conclusion.""'Story to tell'The bill would also reinstate the right to civil legal aid for refugees and extend the age at which parents can sponsor their children to join them in the UK from 18 to 25.Labour said the proposals would ""address anomalies"" in the refugee system and while it would benefit a relatively small number of people, it would have a ""transformational"" effect on their lives.Speaking in Friday's debate, former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the changes would bring ""immigration rules into line with real life"" - and that ""compassion and common sense should take the place of pedantry"". Offering her support, Conservative MP Anna Soubry said refugees were human beings ""each with a story to tell"" of being a victim of war, persecution or natural disaster.By backing the ""modest"" measure, she said it would show the ""type of Conservatives we are all proud to call ourselves"".But her colleague, Will Quince, said he was yet to be convinced that widening the eligibility resettlement criteria was the right thing to do, noting it would do nothing to address the reasons why families had been displaced or address the sources of conflict.He said it was unhelpful for opponents of the bill to be portrayed as ""cold-hearted"" or lacking in empathy. 'Glimmer of hope'Campaigners said Friday's vote offered a ""glimmer of hope"" to the families of refugees separated by conflict.""At the moment, the government's restrictive rules leave refugees isolated, traumatised and alone in the UK, knowing that the people they love still face untold dangers in other countries,"" said Maurice Wren, chief executive of the Refugee Council. The government's decision to close the Dubs resettlement scheme for child refugees from Syria and other war-torn countries was heavily criticised last year.Campaigners say it should have been used to give sanctuary to 3,000 rather than hundreds of child refugees. The government has said it is committed to resettling 20,000 refugees affected by the Syrian conflict and 3,000 vulnerable children and their family members from the Middle East and North Africa region by 2020.It says more than 9,300 individuals have already been resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, almost half of whom are children.The Dubs scheme was named after campaigner and Labour peer Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child refugee before the outbreak of World War Two.It required the UK government to provide assistance to a specified number of unaccompanied child refugees, who arrived in Europe with no family connections.Labour 'to end deportation heartbreak'","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43428805"

The bill would make clear in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country and give ministers the power to ignore emergency injunctions, so that deportations can begin.The bill now going through Parliament aims to prevent further legal challenges to the one-way flights, which were ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court in November last year, but won majority support from MPs in the Commons last month.The prime minister has made stopping migrant crossings of the Channel in small boats one of his five priorities.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda plan flawed at core says cross-party reportSunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billWednesday's debate marks the second of three days of committee stage in the Lords, where peers comb through the draft legislation line by line. They have nearly 100 amendments to consider.After votes on amendments at report stage - the next stage of the bill - peers will have the chance to hold a final vote before sending the legislation back to MPs to consider further.On Monday, Labour peer Baroness Chakrabarti warned the bill ""threatens both the domestic rule of law, especially the separation of powers, and the international rules-based order"".Former Conservative party leader Lord Howard countered that the Supreme Court judgement was a ""finding of opinion"" and suggested the government was therefore correct to override it where necessary.But Tory peer Lord Tugendhat, whose nephew is security minister Tom Tugendhat, said: ""What we are being asked to do really represents the sort of behaviour that the world associates with despots and autocracies, not with an established democracy, not with the mother of Parliaments.""Independent peer Lord Alton of Liverpool said that simply legislating Rwanda is safe ""doesn't make it so"".""Saying a dog is a cat doesn't make it such. It may be your opinion but it isn't true.""Speaking on a visit to Scotland, Lord Cameron said: ""Rwanda is a safe country in our view, they have made huge steps forward over recent years, they look after many refugees in Rwanda very well.""And we need to get this bill through Parliament, get some of these flights away to demonstrate that this country is not going to put up with large-scale illegal migration.""What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda Bill criticised by peers in first Lords debateSunak sees off Tory rebels as MPs back Rwanda billSunak urges Lords to back Rwanda billTory deputy chairs resign to rebel over Rwanda billWhat is the Rwanda vote about?

Writing in the Telegraph, the pair said the draft law did not block off the right to individual appeals over removals and was highly unlikely to ensure significant numbers of migrants were sent to Rwanda before the next election. They called on the government to come forward with amendments to address its limitations. Meanwhile, Tory MPs from the more liberal end of the party say they will support it in its current form, but have warned against any changes further down the line, arguing they could breach international law.It means Mr Sunak is facing the biggest challenge to his authority from his MPs, who could inflict humiliation on the PM over one of his key policies.MPs are currently debating the bill in the Commons, with a vote due from 19:00 GMT onwards.How much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Why does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Chris Mason analysis: PM's authority is on the lineThe government's legislation has been drawn up to revive the Rwanda scheme, after the Supreme Court ruled it unlawful last month over fears it could lead to human rights breaches.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send asylum seekers to, and stop flights being grounded for legal reasons.The aim of the policy is to deter migrants crossing the Channel in small boats - something Mr Sunak has made a key priority of his government.However, some Tory MPs are concerned it does not go far enough to prevent further legal challenges derailing deportations. With Labour and other opposition parties opposing the bill, and with several Tory MPs indicating they could abstain, the parliamentary maths is looking tight for the government.A bill has not been defeated at second reading since 1986.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says he will scrap the Rwanda plan if his party wins the next election, arguing the £290m due to be given to the east African country as part of the scheme would be better spent tackling people-smuggling gangs.Keir Starmer: ''The charade continues'' on RwandaAhead of the vote, several senior Tories, including former defence secretary Ben Wallace and attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, have called on MPs to unite, warning disunity would spell disaster for the party ahead of the next election.The New Conservatives group, whom Mr Sunak met for around an hour on Tuesday morning, has said the bill requires ""major surgery or replacement"".According to MPs present at the meeting, the prime minister told potential rebels he was willing to discuss ""tightening up"" the draft law.Some MPs told Mr Sunak they would abstain or vote against the bill later. However, it is understood others are planning to vote for the bill, in the hope it gets amended further down the line.The European Research Group (ERG) - another group on the party's right - has argued ""very significant amendments"" are needed to prevent legal challenges to Rwanda deportations.The group have not yet revealed how they plan to vote and have been meeting to decide their next steps.Robert Jenrick - who quit as immigration minister over the legislation last week - said it was ""not a bad bill,"" but needed strengthening to prevent individual claims against deportation.Speaking in the Commons, he said deportees would ""stop at nothing"" to avoid being sent to Rwanda, telling MPs: ""give them an inch, and they'll take a mile"".Watch: Mark Francois and David Jones of the European Research Group calls on the government to scrap the billHowever, agreeing to the demands of MPs on the right of the party would risk losing the support of more centrist Tories. The One Nation group, which includes more than 100 Tory MPs, said it was recommending its members vote for the bill at this stage, but warned it would oppose any future amendments ""that would mean the UK government breaching the rule of law and its international obligations"".A defeat of such a key piece of legislation would potentially presage a leadership election for Mr Sunak, perhaps even a general election.Downing Street said the government was listening to the views of MPs but insisted it would not pull the vote.Those who want the Rwanda bill to go further argue it could still leave the scheme open to legal challenge by individuals, who could argue deportation to Rwanda would put them at risk of serious harm.In an attempt to win over critics, the government took the unusual step of publishing a summary of its own legal advice on the scheme. The advice argues that the grounds for individual challenges to deportation will be ""exceptionally narrow"" under the bill, and a blanket ban on appeals would breach international law.It gives examples such as people in the late stages of pregnancy who are unfit to fly or with very rare medical conditions that could not be cared for in Rwanda.However, critics argue that even if only some of these claims succeed, they would still clog up the courts and delay removals.Rwanda law doesn't go far enough, Tory group saysHow much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?UK immigrationImmigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67684785"

She apologised for the distress caused to anyone told they must leave the UK. Labour has disputed her claim, saying the Home Office had said on Tuesday that the decision was taken in 2010 - and is demanding ""clarification"" from Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd.The Windrush row erupted after it emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation.A Home Office task force set up in response to the outcry is now looking at 113 cases as a result of calls to a new hotline.Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdictWho are the Windrush generation?'A nightmare, and it's not over yet'Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK?Landing cards were filled in by Commonwealth citizens arriving from the West Indies and elsewhere, and were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK.They had been stored in a basement for decades but Downing Street says the UK Border Agency approved a business case in June 2009 to dispose of paper records, including the cards.The decision to destroy the cards themselves was taken in October 2010, after the coalition came to power. Mrs May was not involved in the decision, which was taken at official level, said No 10.'I have always thought I was legal'Getty ImagesAnthony Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, has been detained twiceChanges to migration rules introduced when Mrs May was home secretary mean those who lack documents are now being told they need evidence to continue working, access key services or even remain in the UK.Sixty-year-old Anthony Bryan lost his job when he received a letter informing him he had no right to remain in the UK.He says: ""It was a shock because I have always thought I was legal, I was British. I have been here from when I was eight. I didn't give it another thought.""Mr Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, was held in a detention centre twice for nearly three weeks last year.He has since been given leave to remain, but is still waiting for legal paperwork to confirm his right to stay.A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UKThe Windrush row dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accusing the PM of ""pandering to bogus immigration targets"" when she was home secretary and said her efforts to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had caused ""such pain for a whole generation"". ""It led to British citizens being denied NHS treatment, losing their jobs, homes and pensions, thrown into detention centres like criminals and even deported, vital historical records shredded and ministers blaming officials,"" he said.He said the government had shown itself to be ""callous and incompetent"" in the way it had destroyed the Windrush landing cards.The PM said she would not be called ""callous"" by a leader who ""allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party"". Windrush warning over EU citizens' rightsDowning Street said new information was coming to light about the handling of the landing cards all the time, which was why there was a discrepancy between information given out on Tuesday and Wednesday.But a Labour Party spokesman said the government's story was ""shifting by the hour"".""First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. ""At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame onto the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of. Her spokesperson couldn't even say when the cards were destroyed.""Jacqui Smith, who was Labour home secretary until replaced by Alan Johnson in June 2009, told the BBC that it was ""not a policy decision she had made"". Mr Johnson also said he ""had absolutely no recollection at all of being involved"" in the landing card decision.Albert Thompson was told he would have to pay for his cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentationThe prime minister and Mr Corbyn also clashed over the case of a man denied the NHS cancer treatment to which he was entitled because he did not have the right documentation.Mrs May said Albert Thompson would get the treatment he needed, although he was not a member of the Windrush generation. He is understood to have arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973. Mr Corbyn, who first raised his case a month ago, said he was still waiting.Mr Thompson's MP, Chuka Umunna, later suggested the prime minister had ""misled"" MPs over the case.'I'm an Englishman': Windrush storiesThe prime minister had begun the session with a fresh apology to the Windrush migrants, saying: ""These people are British. They are part of us.""There was no question of forcing anyone who had made their life in the UK and was here legally to leave, she said. The prime minister also defended Home Secretary Amber Rudd amid Labour calls for her to ""consider her position"".Earlier, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Ms Rudd of withholding information about how many people have been wrongly detained or deported.Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""This is one of the seats that Theresa May called the election to win"", he said after his triumph. He was investigated by Labour after a confrontation with party chairman Ian Lavery in the House of Commons in July 2018, which he called the party's code of conduct on anti-Semitism a ""disgrace"".He had criticised the party's decision at the time not to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and all its examples - a move that was subsequently reversed.The investigation was later dropped, with Mr Austin complaining that the party's handling of the case had been ""appalling"".Although he backed Remain in 2016, he is opposed to the idea of holding another EU referendum.

He added that people under threat of deportation would still be able to appeal on the grounds that Rwanda, even if generally safe, is not individually safe for them.""I think that a political choice has been made to bring forward a bill which doesn't do the job,"" he said.He had quit as immigration minister because he couldn't ask MPs to vote for a legislation he deemed ""a weak bill that won't work,"" he added.The government had already introduced two bills to deal with the issue of illegal migration, he said, adding: ""It's three strikes or you're out"".Although he conceded the Rwanda plan could eventually lead to some ""symbolic"" flights taking off, there would not be enough deportations to deter people from crossing the English Channel.The bill to revive the scheme has divided opinions among Conservative MPs, whose support Mr Sunak will need to ensure the bill passes its first parliamentary stage next week.PA MediaMinisters argue the threat of deportation to Rwanda will deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe prime minister has previously insisted his legislation will only allow legal challenges from those who can prove they are at ""real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm"".Speaking on the same programme, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove echoed this point, adding that only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals would still be allowed. The government's law had already been endorsed in a ""plethora of legal opinion,"" he said, and was a ""robust bill that is legally sound"".Some liberal Tories have argued it goes too far in trying to bypass the courts, and puts the UK at risk of breaching its international legal obligations towards refugees.But others on the right of the party say it does not go far enough, and will continue to be derailed by legal challenges.Mr Jenrick added that he, along with like-minded Conservative MPs, hoped to persuade ministers ""that there is a better way"" to design the new law, adding he wanted the bill to work and create a ""powerful deterrent"". Tory faction fight The different factions within the Tory party are taking legal advice on the legislation, and are expected to deliver their verdict on the bill before Tuesday's vote.On Sunday, a leading member of the European Research Group (ERG) - a group on the right of the party - said its own legal advice found the law was not fit for purpose.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Bill Cash said the current wording of the legislation was not ""sufficiently watertight"".At the vote on Tuesday, MPs will be asked to decide whether the bill should be blocked completely, or allowed to progress to its next stage in Parliament.Labour and opposition parties have already said they will try and vote it down, meaning the government needs to ensure enough Tory MPs vote for it to allow it to pass.Tory critics of the bill could decide to allow the bill to pass at this stage, possibly by abstaining, in the hope of securing concessions from the government as it goes through the Commons.Minimum salary hikeMr Jenrick also warned the Tories would face ""red hot fury"" from voters unless the party is able to do more to tackle both legal and illegal migration.The governmentunveiled measureslast week to reduce levels of legal migration, following a backlash within the party after official figures showed it reached a record 745,000 in 2022.Labour has also said it thinks legal migration is too high, blaming the current high levels on a lack of training and skills development for Britons.Also speaking to Laura Kuenssberg, shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall said the party agreed with a government decision to raise the £26,200 minimum salary to apply for a UK work visa.However she refused to say whether its proposed hike to £38,700 was the right level, adding her party would like official migration advisers to publish their evidence first.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Tory MPs under pressure to back Sunak Rwanda planRobert JenrickUK immigrationRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67674763"
"11 May 2024","What could go wrong for Keir Starmer? A lot actually, Laura Kuenssberg writes","What could go wrong for Keir Starmer? A lot actually, Laura Kuenssberg writes11 May 2024ShareLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergShareGetty ImagesKeir Starmer's success was sketched across the map of England at the local elections last week. The Labour leadership is bouncing from nabbing another of the Tories' MPs, Natalie Elphicke - and polling since the council results puts him further ahead than ever.What could possibly go wrong for him? A lot, actually. The general election is still months away and there are plenty of potential pitfalls between Starmer and the shiny black door of No 10. Don't get complacent First, conversations across the Labour Party suggest the danger of taking victory for granted - being complacent - is the number one risk. A shadow minister warns: ""People sometimes act as if it's already happened… not realising the scale of effort required to do that."" A source tells me holiday was cancelled at Labour HQ in December, until July, with all staff expected to be on standby for a general election. There's no taking it easy now: a similar edict is in place from September to December.Sir John Curtice: Do local election results point to a hung Parliament?Kuenssberg: Are Tories resigned to electoral fate under Sunak?Local election results in full""We have to keep our discipline and keep on our message,"" says another insider. That discipline is important in avoiding the kind of public sparring between colleagues that was all too common in the bruising Corbyn era, and which the public doesn't like. It's important in avoiding stray comments that would give opponents ammo to attack - just look at how the Conservatives played with Labour's wavering over its now retired vow to spend £28bn a year on the economy going green.But it's also important because if a Labour victory is hammered into people's expectations, that could affect how the election campaign is fought. ""If everyone thinks we are getting a thumping great majority, you end up with the campaign being a referendum on Labour,"" one source says. Instead, ""we want it to be about the threat of five more years of the Tories"".Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.Another senior figure tells me: ""What you hear is that people think they are voting Labour because they don't want the Tories - rather than enthusiastically voting for us."" The party would love there to be more excitement about them. But some insiders want the focus to stay on the Conservatives, who are struggling, and a choice between the two big parties.With that in mind, Labour was only too happy for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to claim that the local election results suggested the country was on course for a hung parliament. They were pleased for the public to be reminded that a Labour victory is not a foregone conclusion.Don't get rattledSecond, while the Tories have been stuck in the doldrums in the polls for months, Labour cannot predict or control much of what happens before the election. On 6 October last year, the world didn't know what was about to happen in Israel. The shocking events of 7 October and the intense conflict since then has unsettled many in the Labour Party. The local elections confirmed the leadership's attitude to war in Gaza affected votes in some areas, and unhappiness over foreign policy feels something of a proxy for general grumpiness on the left. There is just no telling what other events could provoke further disagreement, or what unexpected events could shift the polls. The better economic news of the last few days also helps the Conservatives to make their planned argument - that the country has turned a corner, and that Labour would put that at risk. And of course the Conservatives are looking for any Labour vulnerabilities to push.On this week's show are the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron and Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster generalThe actor Dominic West also joins the show to talk about his new West End showWatch live on BBC One and iPlayer from 09:00 BST on SundayFollow latest updates in text and video on the BBC News website from 08:30Viewers can send questions or comments to @bbclaurak on x or instagram and email kuenssberg@bbc.co.uk Tory sources point to Labour's position on immigration, cancelling the government's Rwanda plan. They'll likely put pressure on Labour over the enhanced relationship it wants with the EU. Then there's Labour's plan for extra rights in the workplace, what Conservatives have dubbed ""French-style union laws"" - another pressure point.There is no question that Keir Starmer's Labour Party is a very different beast to Jeremy Corbyn's tribe as they went into the last general election. But how able are they to shrug off Conservative attacks? ""We can rattle them quite easily,"" a Conservative source suggests, pointing to pressure they believe led to Labour ditching its £28bn commitment. A Labour figure says Starmer's team needs to avoid ""being distracted by the madness"". Sometimes, ""they know it's a trap, but they feel they have no option but walk into it anyway"". Politics is about how able you are to defend yourself, as well as how sharply you can attack. Don't stretch too far Last, Keir Starmer faces a classic political conundrum. To win, it helps if you look like a winner - but overstretch yourself, and it could all go wrong. Not every eager young staffer in Labour these days was born when, in 1992, Neil Kinnock's Sheffield rally showed him prematurely triumphant, with all the crashing disappointment that followed. But the memory is present in plenty of Labour minds (Kinnock, incidentally, warned on BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster that voters are not fully convinced by Starmer and his party). Even Starmer's most loyal lieutenants acknowledge privately that he is unlikely to be a politician with razzle and dazzle. But he has changed since he became leader of a battered party in 2020. One Starmer ally says he is ""definitely showing that confidence - and he's earned it - he has gone through some really, really difficult stuff for the party, he's grafted it and worked it up"". As the party's reaction to the second defection in as many weeks suggested, there is a fine line to walk between breeding success and too much swagger. Some of his MPs' reactions to this week's defection of Natalie Elphicke - not just a Conservative, but from the Conservative right - highlighted that risk. 1:05Defecting MP Natalie Elphicke : Tories under Sunak have broken many election promisesSure, they want to appeal to what Starmer repeatedly described as ""all reasonable people"". But for some of his own gang, Elphicke does not fall into that category. One senior figure told me: ""With the over excitement of the scale of a win there might be a strategic error of going for the stretch of the Tories we can pull over, rather than protecting what we already have."" The inside story of Tory MP's defection to LabourYes, to pull off a victory Labour has to appeal to voters who wouldn't have dreamt of backing them in 2019 - and in huge numbers. But it also has to keep its existing base on board, to make sure they campaign and turn out. What Labour bosses never forget - even if some of its more excitable supporters do - is that to win a majority, the party has to win a swing bigger than Tony Blair did in 1997, when he redrew the electoral map. To have a majority of even one MP, Keir Starmer, Rachel Reeves, Wes Streeting, Angela Rayner and the rest of his team have to do better - far better - than Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, John Prescott, Jack Straw, David Blunkett and the rest.In 2019 it felt implausible that they would be anywhere within reach. Now, the party is increasingly taking decisions and marking positions as those it would defend in government. It is spending huge amounts of time preparing to govern, not just campaign.Yet as both Starmer and Sunak are only too happy to remind you, voters face a different choice in a general election than what they say to a pollster, or when they pick a local councillor. It is still ""if"" not ""when"" the Labour leader becomes prime minister - and there is plenty of danger ahead.What questions would you like to ask Lord Cameron or Jonathan Ashworth this Sunday?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

"24 January 2024","PMQs gives taste of political mud-slinging to come","PMQs gives taste of political mud-slinging to come24 January 2024ShareHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentShareMaria Unger / UK ParliamentSome Conservatives may be trying to force a change of leader, but at Prime Minister's Questions we got a taste of the political cut and thrust we will see until the election, assuming Rishi Sunak remains in place.Sir Keir Starmer darted around different issues, using each of them as an opportunity to land personal attacks on Mr Sunak. The Labour leader targeted Mr Sunak's wealth and background, repeating a charge from earlier this month that the prime minister ""doesn't understand"" Britain.His previous career also came under fire, with a claim that he was ""making millions betting the misery of working people during the financial crisis"". Are Tory MPs plotting to get rid of Rishi Sunak?Why Tory rows are back on displayWhen is the next general election?But Sir Keir's primary focus was on splits within the Conservatives. He accused Mr Sunak of being ""bullied"" by his own party, after former minister Sir Simon Clarke called for him to be replaced as PM. 1:09Rishi Sunak is asked by the Labour leader why his own MPs consider him an ""obstacle to recovery"".In turn the prime minister went after Labour's green policies, claiming the party's £28bn investment pledge would mean tax rises.He also attacked Sir Keir for his legal career, pointing out for the second week in a row that he did legal work for Hizb-ut Tahrir, which the government proscribed as a terrorist organisation last week. And he labelled the Labour leader ""the human weathervane"" for his changing positions over the years. It may seem like tedious political mud-slinging, or you may think these are the crucial questions of character which prime ministers and potential prime ministers must answer.Either way, get used to it.1:08Labour MP Tahir Ali: PM has ""blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands""Meanwhile Sir Keir saw his boast that he had ""changed my party"" flung straight back at him when Mr Sunak faced questions about the situation in Gaza. MPs on the Labour frontbench looked angry to say the least as Tahir Ali, the MP for Birmingham Hall Green, claimed that Mr Sunak had ""the blood of thousands of innocent people on his hands"" because of the government's position on the conflict, as he called for ""an immediate ceasefire"".

"3 July 2023","Tory MPs issue plan for Rishi Sunak to slash migration","Tory MPs issue plan for Rishi Sunak to slash migration3 July 2023ShareJoshua NevettBBC PoliticsShareGetty ImagesRishi Sunak has been under pressure to reduce migration to the UKA group of Tory MPs is calling on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so ""risks eroding public trust"".The New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election.The group of MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers.But critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy.Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government believes it is ""striking the right balance between keeping migration as low as possible while providing staff for key areas"".The UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.The ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong.The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010.The party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000.Sunak says migration 'too high' as new record setWho is allowed to come to live in the UK?Moving target Tories keep trying to hitIn a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives say the British public ""did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings"".""Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,"" the report says.The report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of like-minded Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, Miriam Cates and James Daly.At the report's launch, Mr Hunt, Ms Cates and Mr Daly insisted they were loyal to the prime minister, but felt his government could go further on cutting immigration.One of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers.The report says this policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000, leading to a reduction in long-term inward migration to the UK of 82,000.Part of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn £38,000 a year or more.A report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22.Sam Monaghan, chief executive at Methodist Homes, said not being able to recruit carers from overseas would put more pressure on the sector.""Cutting off a key supply of care workers at a time when 500,000 people nationwide are waiting for care is not the answer,"" Mr Monaghan said.Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government was not planning to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list.The government was ""using the flexibility we have through our migration system to ensure we have sufficient staff in key areas"" and ""looking to boost the numbers of domestic care staff that are available"", Downing Street said.Ms Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector.She said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force ""employers to look at recruiting local young people"". ""We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,"" the Tory MP said.But fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said while the principle of reducing met migration was right, there was a shortage of care workers in the UK.""It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,"" he said. ""There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country.""Some of the report's other proposals include: Tightening restrictions on student visas to stop graduates staying in the UK for longer than two years without a job offerCapping the number of refugees legally accepted for resettlement in the UK at 20,000A 5% cap on the amount of social housing that councils can give to non-UK nationalsRaising the health surcharge that an individual immigrant would pay to use the NHS to £2,700 per person, per yearMadeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said ""trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard"".""Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,"" she said.She said immigration policy was a ""political choice"" and there was ""no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive"".But she said the report does not ""engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve"".""For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,"" Ms Sumption said. ""International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education.""She said some of the proposals in the report were ""a bit outlandish"".""Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,"" she added. ""However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them.""Sunak denies he's lost control of rising migrationHow many people come to live in the UK?Legal migration is too high, says Rishi SunakConservative PartyUK immigrationImmigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66084962"
"12 December 2023","Rishi Sunak's Rwanda law doesn't go far enough, Tory faction says","Rishi Sunak's Rwanda law doesn't go far enough, Tory faction says12 December 2023ShareJoshua Nevett, political reporter & Henry Zeffman, chief political correspondentBBC NewsShare1:43Watch: Mark Francois and David Jones of the European Research Group calls on the government to scrap the billA group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs have said the bill at the centre of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Rwanda asylum plan will not work as it stands.The European Research Group (ERG) said a new law aimed at overcoming legal hurdles does not go ""far enough to deliver the policy"".But the group has not decided whether to back the bill in a vote on Tuesday. Tory MPs from different factions are divided and are considering whether to vote for the bill at its first stage.A rebellion by Tory MPs could sink this central policy of Mr Sunak's and seriously weaken his authority.The ERG commissioned a so-called star chamber of lawyers to analyse the Safety of Rwanda Bill and held a meeting to present their findings ahead of Tuesday's vote.In a setback for Mr Sunak, the group said the bill ""provides a partial and incomplete solution to the problem of legal challenges in the UK courts being used as stratagems to delay or defeat the removal of illegal migrants to Rwanda"".The group said resolving the issues raised by their lawyers ""would require very significant amendments"".ERG chairman Mark Francois said: ""The feeling very much in the meeting is that the government would be best advised to pull the bill and come up with a revised version that works better than this one which has so many holes in it."" The meeting also included other groups on the right of the Tory Party. Downing Street said the government would continue to listen to the views of MPs but it believed the bill was ""strong enough to achieve its aims"". LIVE: Tory MPs say Rwanda plan doesn't go far enoughHow much trouble is PM in over Rwanda bill?Rwanda bill is too weak to be a deterrent, says Robert JenrickWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The ERG's legal analysis argues the bill still allows individuals to challenge their removal to Rwanda if their specific personal circumstances mean this would put them at risk of serious harm. It says this represents ""a significant risk to delivery of the scheme"". In an attempt to win over critics, the government has published a summary of its legal position on the scheme. The document says the bill allows for ""an exceptionally narrow route to individual challenge"".It gives examples such as people in the late stages of pregnancy who are unfit to fly or with very rare medical conditions that could not be cared for in Rwanda. The document adds: ""In any case, completely blocking any court challenges would be a breach of international law and alien to the UK's constitutional tradition of liberty and justice.""It concludes that ""the government's approach is tough but fair and lawful"" and ""seeks to uphold our international obligations"". The Rwanda bill has split Conservative MPs, with some more moderate Tories arguing the bill risks breaching the UK's international legal obligations towards refugees.The centrist One Nation Conservatives will hold a separate evening meeting in Parliament before releasing a statement on their judgment.PA MediaThe Rwanda policy aims to deter people crossing the Channel in small boatsEarlier, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps urged MPs to support the bill and denied Mr Sunak's leadership was in ""chaos"" over the Rwanda policy.The defence secretary said he had ""no doubt at all"" the legislation would pass in the House of Commons.It is very rare for a bill to be defeated at its first Commons hurdle as there are opportunities for MPs to propose changes at later stages. However, Labour and opposition parties have already said they will try and vote it down, meaning the government needs to ensure enough Tory MPs vote for it to allow it to pass.Tory critics of the bill could decide to allow it to pass at this stage, possibly by abstaining, in the hope of securing concessions from the government as it goes through the Commons.Last week, the government introduced the legislation which would see people seeking UK asylum sent to Rwanda, after the policy was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last month.The legislation seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country, with a view to stopping flights being grounded on legal grounds.The Rwanda policy is part of the government's plan to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats.Mr Sunak has said ""stopping the boats"" is one of five main priorities, after a record 45,774 people made the journey last year.Charm offensiveAhead of the vote, the government has been circulating modelling showing the projected effects of the Rwanda bill.According to Home Office modelling conducted earlier this year, 90% of those appealing against deportation to Rwanda would see their appeals rejected by the government between 10 and 12 days after arriving in the UK because they would fail to provide evidence they face serious harm if deported to the African country. Of the 10% given permission to appeal to an immigration tribunal, only 5% would be expected to have their appeals accepted, with the rest sent to Rwanda, the model claims.The projections are part of a document prepared in March during discussions about the illegal migration bill when Suella Braverman was home secretary and Robert Jenrick was immigration minister.Both Mrs Braverman and Mr Jenrick now argue the emergency legislation does not go far enough, with Mr Jenrick resigning from his government role last week over the issue.The modelling, which has been seen by the BBC, was first reported by The Times.The government will use the document to try to win over Conservative MPs concerned that there would be too many successful appeals.But Mr Sunak's critics argue that the Supreme Court's ruling last month that Rwanda is an unsafe country for asylum seekers means the context has changed since the modelling was conducted, and more appeals would be successful.One sceptical senior Tory source said the model was ""outdated and analytically flawed"".""There was never any modelling done for the new Rwanda bill because they failed to plan,"" the source said. ""Even this old, optimistic model says it could take more than two months to remove a migrant. It would be laughable if it wasn't so serious.""Last week, the Home Office's top civil servant Sir Matthew Rycroft revealed the UK had given Rwanda a further £100m this year to deliver the scheme.The figure was on top of the £140m already paid to the country and a further £50m expected next year. Appearing in front of the Commons Public Accounts Committee earlier on Monday, Sir Matthew said the figure had been published after the government discovered it had been ""inadvertently"" disclosed to the International Monetary Fund by someone in Rwanda. However, he refused to say how much more money the UK had already agreed to pay Rwanda for subsequent years of the initial five-year deal.PM faces Covid inquiry and Rwanda vote in key weekSunak's 'weak' Rwanda plan won't work - JenrickUK earmarks £700m for small boat arrivals to 2030Refugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67680136"
"23 February 2019","Ian Austin quits Labour blaming Jeremy Corbyn's leadership","Ian Austin quits Labour blaming Jeremy Corbyn's leadership23 February 2019ShareShare0:35Ian Austin spoke to 5 Live about quitting LabourIan Austin has become the ninth MP to quit Labour this week, blaming leader Jeremy Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"".He told the BBC the leadership had failed to tackle anti-Semitism and had turned the party into a ""narrow sect"".But the MP for Dudley North said he had no plans to join the new Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs.Mr Corbyn denied claims bullying was rife in Labour, telling Sky News any ""bad behaviour"" had been dealt with.Meanwhile, his deputy Tom Watson said Mr Austin's departure was a ""serious blow"" to Labour.A Labour spokesman suggested Mr Austin should stand down and call a by-election in his West Midlands seat, which he won by only 22 votes in 2017. Mr Austin told the Express & Star newspaper, which first broke news of his resignation, that it was the ""most difficult decision"" he had ever had to take. Who is Ian Austin? Who are the new independent MPs?What does it feel like to quit a party?The MP, who has represented the West Midlands constituency since 2005, later told BBC West Midlands that he was ""ashamed"" of the party.""I grew up listening to my dad, who was a refugee from the Holocaust, teaching me about the evils of hatred and prejudice,"" he said.""One of the main reasons I joined the Labour Party as a teenager here in Dudley more than 35 years ago was to fight racism and I could never have believed I would be leaving the Labour party because of racism too.""Analysis: Push and pull for Labour MPs malcontentsBy political correspondent Jonathan BlakeGetty ImagesIan Austin (right), campaigning with Harriet Harman and John Prescott in 2010Another MP resigns, pouring scathing criticism on their leader at the end of a watershed week at Westminster.Ian Austin's decision not to join his former colleagues in the new Independent Group is telling. It shows that he felt strongly enough about the problem of anti-Semitism within Labour to quit the party he has been a member of for 45 years on that basis alone. But it also suggests that Parliament's newest group may be seen above all for what, in the absence of any policies, unites them. That is support for a further referendum on leaving the EU, something Ian Austin would not sign up to. For him the push from a party in which he no longer felt at home was more powerful that the pull of life in a new party on the outside. Other Labour and Conservative MPs who are considering their future will also need to decide whether they're better off out than in, and whether the Independent Group is the place for them. Explaining his decision not to call a by-election, Mr Austin said he had been openly critical of Mr Corbyn during the 2017 election campaign.  He said his ""work for the people in this community is going to carry on as it always has"". Tom Watson, Labour's deputy leader, said he was ""deeply saddened"" by his close friend's decision to leave.""I didn't want him to go, not just because he is a friend but because Labour needs people of his experience, calibre and passion if we are to win,"" he added.Mr Watson recently said Labour had been slow to deal with the anti-Semitism row and he ""no longer recognises"" the party .But Mr Corbyn, who has been in Madrid for a meeting of European socialists, took issue with Mr Watson's comments and said he would talk to him about them in the ""near future"".The Labour leader told Sky News: ""There is no place for harshness, bullying or anything else in the party. I don't believe that it exists on a wide scale.""Where there is bad behaviour we deal with it. Where there is a problem we deal with it.""'Zero tolerance'Derby North MP Chris Williamson, a close ally of Mr Corbyn, said his departure was ""no loss"".Describing Mr Austin as ""stuck in the 1990s... a New Labour relic"", he told the BBC: ""I for many years wasn't particularly a fan of Tony Blair, but I didn't throw my toys out of the pram.""Mr Austin ""fought the last election under false pretences"", using Labour's brand to get elected, Mr Williamson added.Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 monthsCorbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish groupIn an interview with London's Evening Standard, conducted before Mr Austin's resignation, shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people behaving in a way ""construed as anti-Semitic"" that: ""They will be dealt with. Full stop. They are not welcome.""He admitted the leadership let down Jewish MP Luciana Berger, who described the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" when leaving to join the Independent Group.There was not enough support for Ms Berger, ""not enough action"", Mr McDonnell said, before pledging to ""sort it"".Mr Austin was a minister for regional affairs under Gordon Brown and part of Ed Miliband's front-bench team in opposition.He said he ""agreed"" with the eight MPs who left Labour to form the Independent Group earlier this week that things ""have got to change"".However, he wants a Brexit deal concluded, rather than a further referendum on EU membership.While Mr Austin did not rule out joining the group, he told BBC Radio 5 Live he was ""not anticipating doing that any time soon"".Ms Berger tweeted that she fully understood why he had come to ""this difficult and painful decision"" of leaving Labour.Another of the defectors, Chuka Umunna, tweeted his ""massive respect"" to Mr Austin, adding: ""It's painful and hard but he has stayed true to his values and what he believes to be the national interest.""The MPs leaving their partiesCorbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish groupWhat does it feel like to quit a party?Shadow cabinet clash over anti-SemitismLabour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47330079"
"18 January 2024","Rishi Sunak sees off Conservative rebels as MPs back Rwanda bill","Rishi Sunak sees off Conservative rebels as MPs back Rwanda bill18 January 2024ShareKate Whannel & Henry ZeffmanBBC PoliticsShareRishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan battle isn’t over yetRishi Sunak has succeeded in getting his key Rwanda bill through the House of Commons after a Tory rebellion failed to materialise.The bill, which aims to stop legal challenges against ministers' plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, was approved by 320 votes to 276 votes.Dozens of Tories thought the bill was flawed and had threatened to rebel but in the end, only 11 voted against it.The bill now goes to the House of Lords where it will face stiff opposition.Mr Sunak argues that deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to get to the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats, but Labour has labelled the plan an expensive ""gimmick"".The government is hoping to get the flights to Rwanda running by the spring.The prime minister is due to hold a Downing Street press conference on the policy at 10:15 GMT.What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Over the past two days MPs on the right of the Conservative Party have tried to change the bill, arguing that, without amendments, the government's Rwanda plan could be blocked by the courts.On Wednesday, former immigration minister Robert Jenrick tabled an amendment which would permit the UK government to ignore parts of human rights law in relation to sending people to Rwanda. Mr Jenrick also proposed an amendment which would ensure ministers automatically reject last-minute interim orders from the European Court of Human Rights.Such an order was responsible for blocking a flight to Rwanda back in June 2022.The amendment was not approved by MPs but received the backing of 61 Conservatives - the biggest rebellion of Mr Sunak's premiership.Some MPs had suggested they would be willing to abstain or even vote against the entire bill if it remained unchanged.The bill could have fallen if about 30 Conservatives had voted against it - an outcome that would have severely damaged the prime minister's authority, potentially fatally.However, in the event, just 11 MPs - including Mr Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - voted against it.Other Tory MPs on the list include Miriam Cates, Sir Simon Clarke, Mark Francois and Danny Kruger.Eighteen Conservative MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining.Conservative Danny Kruger, who voted against the bill, said some of his colleagues had opted to support the legislation despite their concerns in order to avoid ""political disruption"".Sir Simon Clarke, who also opposed the bill said: ""All Conservatives want the Rwanda policy to succeed... the profound misgivings some of us hold about the bill are on record, but history will now relate who was right.""Labour opposed the bill, with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper labelling the policy a ""costly con"" that had so far failed to send any asylum seekers to Rwanda.Home Secretary James Cleverly defended the plan arguing that it sent ""an unambiguously clear message that if you enter the United Kingdom illegally you cannot stay"". ""This bill has been meticulously drafted to end the merry-go-round of legal challenges,"" he added. The debate over the legislation has exposed on-going divisions among Conservatives - on Tuesday evening two deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quit their roles in order to vote for the rebel amendments.Despite his concerns, Mr Clarke-Smith back the bill at the final stage, while Mr Anderson did not register a vote. One rebel source told the BBC: ""It is not the case that tonight's vote is the end of matters. ""If the House of Lords chooses - as I suspect they will - to send back amendments that weaken the bill, the response of those [right-wing Conservative MPs] will be to table amendments in lieu that toughen the bill.""HoCThe Rwanda bill passed the through the House of Commons by 320 votes for to 276 votes againstThe bill is now expected to face further opposition in the House of Lords, where many peers are concerned about whether it complies with international law. Crossbench peer Lord Carlile, a leading lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that while peers would not ""thwart the government"", the Lords had a responsibility to ""protect the public from abuses of legal correctness and principle by the government"". ""We've seen in various other countries the damage that can be done when governments use perceived and often ill-judged political imperatives to place themselves above the courts,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a step towards totalitarianism and an attitude that the United Kingdom usually deprecates.""As his press conference, Mr Sunak is likely to urge peers to pass the bill quickly to finally allow the policy to get off the ground. But even once the bill becomes law, Tory rebels say it will not work as they believe planes will be grounded once again by legal challenges.Home Office minister Chris Philp told BBC Breakfast the government was aiming for flights to take off this spring. He played down divisions in the party and insisted ""there was near unanimity on the Conservative side that this bill as a whole made sense and represents a very significant step forward"". On Wednesday Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said he would return money to the UK  if no asylum seekers were sent to his country.The UK has so far paid £240m to the east African nation and is expected to pay a further £50m.A Rwandan government spokeswoman later said the country had ""no obligation"" to return the money but would consider a request for a refund from the UK. In Westminster, a Downing Street spokesman was forced to deny it was trying to change the Civil Service code to include a presumption that emergency injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights should be ignored.At the start of the day Home Office Minister Michael Tomlinson had said the government was ""looking at that"", but hours later No 10 said it was not seeking to rewrite the code. The Cabinet Office later issued guidance stating that it was the ""responsibility"" of civil servants to ""implement"" a minister's decision to ignore rulings from the court.

Speaking after the defeat, Sir Keir said: ""I regret we had to withdraw our candidate, and apologise to voters in Rochdale.""I took that decision. It was the right decision.""He promised that Labour would put forward ""a first-class candidate, a unifier"" to fight the seat at the general election, expected later this year.Mr Sunak said the Rochdale contest had been ""one of the most divisive campaigns that we have seen in recent times"" but that the Tories had ""run a really positive campaign"". 0:56George Galloway has orange confetti thrown at him by Just Stop Oil campaigner Rev Mark Coleman, as he gives his victory speech in RochdaleThe by-election was triggered by the death of Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd, who had held the seat with a majority of nearly 10,000.Labour had been expected to win, but their campaign was thrown into turmoil when remarks from their candidate Mr Ali, widely regarded as antisemitic, were published by the Daily Mail. Mr Ali apologised for his remarks but the party decided to pull their support and ordered their members stop campaigning for him.The Israel-Gaza conflict featured heavily in the by-election, with Mr Galloway telling voters in a campaign leaflet: ""The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do.""Labour has been divided over how to respond to the war and last year several frontbenchers quit their roles in order to vote for an immediate ceasefire.  Veteran political pollster Sir John Curtice told the BBC the Rochdale result would intensify pressure on Sir Keir to toughen up Labour's stance on Israel.However, he doubted there would be much impact on the general election result, because it is ""unlikely that anybody else has the ability to... exploit this issue [the war in Gaza] in the way that Mr Galloway is uniquely able to"".Mr Tully, who got 6,638 votes, is well-known in Rochdale as he runs a garage business and is involved with the town's rugby club.He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I feel I've turned the heads of people who don't usually vote because nothing ever really changes with mainstream politics and parties.""Reform UK has performed well in recent by-elections, coming third in both Wellingborough and Kingswood, but their candidate in Rochdale, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, was beaten into sixth place with 1,968 votes.The Campaign Against Antisemitism said it was ""extremely concerned"" by Mr Galloway's victory, saying he had an  ""atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community"", including calling for Bradford, when he was an MP there, to be declared an ""Israel-free zone"".Are you in Rochdale?

"30 December 2020","Brexit vote: Starmer faces Labour revolt over backing for deal","Brexit vote: Starmer faces Labour revolt over backing for deal30 December 2020ShareSharePA MediaSir Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion over his decision to back Boris Johnson's EU trade deal on Wednesday.The Labour leader will order his MPs to vote for the deal in the Commons, ensuring it should pass into law in time for the UK's exit from EU rules. Sir Keir has called the deal ""thin"" and not what the government promised, but better than no deal.Critics led by ex-shadow Chancellor John McDonnell are urging the Labour leader not to back the ""rotten"" deal.SNP MPs to vote against Brexit trade dealLandmark post-Brexit trade deal to be signedWhere do UK political parties stand on Brexit vote?EU ambassadors approve post-Brexit trade dealOther opposition parties, including the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and all Northern Ireland parties that take seats at Westminster, have indicated they will be voting against the deal.But the prime minister has received a boost from a powerful group of backbench Tory Brexiteers, who have indicated they will back the deal.The European Research Group (ERG) said it had examined the text in detail and concluded that it ""preserves the UK's sovereignty as a matter of law"".'Sidelines'The government bill - which puts the trade deal agreed with the EU into law - would have passed comfortably in any case, thanks to Labour support, when MPs and peers are recalled from their Christmas recess to vote on it on Wednesday.Sir Keir, who campaigned against Brexit, has hit back at calls for Labour to abstain in the vote so it cannot be blamed for any economic damage that may result from the deal, and hold the government to account more effectively in the coming months.He has said the agreement - announced by Mr Johnson on Christmas Eve, following months of wrangling - does not do enough to protect the environment, jobs and workers' rights.But he wants Labour to back it because, he argues, the only alternative is a damaging no-deal exit from the EU single market and customs union on Thursday. He has said Labour MPs must vote for the deal, rather than abstain, because it ""it is not credible for Labour to be on the sidelines"".On Sunday, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds - who reportedly has her own misgivings about backing a deal - urged Labour MPs to vote for it.""I'm not going to say to you that this is the deal that Labour would have secured because it really isn't - this is a thin deal - but we don't want to create more problems for businesses right now by preventing the implementation of what the government has achieved.""'Rotten deal'But in a statement organised by left-wing groups Another Europe is Possible and Labour for a Socialist Europe, her predecessor as shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, urged Labour to abstain.The statement, which is signed by figures from across the party, says it is the duty of the opposition to provide proper Parliamentary scrutiny and to set out an alternative.""That task gets harder if opposition parties fall into the trap of rallying around this rotten deal,"" it said.""We are witnessing an act of vandalism against our livelihoods, our rights and our horizons.""We call on Labour, the Labour movement and other opposition parties not to support the Tories' Brexit deal when it is put to a vote in the House of Commons.""Signatories include former cabinet ministers and leading pro-Europeans Ben Bradshaw and Lord Adonis, as well as former MEPs, councillors and local activists.Norwich South MP Clive Lewis signed the letter and said he would be abstaining as the deal was ""a long-term bear-trap"".He told BBC News that Sir Keir was ""making a fundamental mistake,"" adding: ""If he'd whipped to abstain he'd have a unified party.""Separately, some Labour MPs have indicated they are likely to abstain or vote against the deal.Bermondsey and Old Southwark MP Neil Coyle said research by the IPPR think tank proved the deal was a ""another nail in the coffin"" for workers' rights.In a tweet, he said that an abstention did not allow the possibility of no deal.""An abstention registers concerns about the deal without allowing the catastrophe of no deal.""Allow Twitter content?This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"14 June 2018","Brexit: MPs reject bid to stay in EEA amid Labour revolt","Brexit: MPs reject bid to stay in EEA amid Labour revolt14 June 2018ShareSharePAAnti-Brexit campaigners have been protesting outside the Houses of Parliament every dayAttempts to keep the UK in the European Economic Area after Brexit have been defeated in the House of Commons despite dozens of Labour MPs defying the leader's instructions on the issue.MPs voted by 327 to 126 against a House of Lords proposal for a close relationship with the EU like Norway's.Jeremy Corbyn urged his MPs to abstain but 75 voted for and 15 against, while six quit their Labour roles.MPs overturned six further amendments peers had put forward.What was the vote about?MPs were deciding whether the UK should stay part of the European Economic Area after it leaves the EU - a similar arrangement to non-EU countries Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.Like EU members, these countries are part of the EU single market - in return they are obliged to make a financial contribution and accept many EU laws. The free movement of people also applies in the zone as it does in the EU.Supporters of the EEA argue it would give the UK the closest possible relationship with the EU without actually being a member, as it would offer full access to the single market.But critics say it would require the UK to adhere to EU rules without having a say in them - and would not be in keeping with the spirit of the 2016 referendum result.After the House of Lords altered the government's EU Withdrawal Bill in favour of EEA membership, the House of Commons agreed to change it back on Wednesday evening.The government won the vote comfortably after Labour abstained, although three Tory MPs, Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry and Dominic Grieve, rebelled themselves and backed the motion.PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances'

Labour MPs were dividedJeremy Corbyn said EEA membership was ""not the right option"" for Britain but that he understood the difficulties the issue posed for MPs representing strongly Leave or Remain constituencies.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Labour MP Laura Smith defended her decision to quit as shadow defence minister because she did not want to follow the leader's instruction to abstain.The MP for Crewe and Nantwich said she wanted to oppose the Lords amendment, saying remaining part of the EEA was not in the interests of her constituents who had voted to leave the EU in 2016.UK ParliamentLabour MPs Anna McMorrin and Tonia Antoniazzi have stepped down from their frontbench rolesMs Smith, who backed Remain in the referendum, said there were ""legitimate reasons"" why people had backed Brexit, adding: ""The country is divided on this issue and we need to start bringing people together.""On the other side of the debate were her Labour colleagues Ged Killen, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin, Ellie Reeves and Rosie Duffield who stepped down as parliamentary private secretaries to support EEA membership.In her resignation letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Reeves said her Lewisham West and Penge constituency had voted by two to one to stay in the EU and hundreds had contacted her in support of staying part of the EEA. Earlier, Labour failed in an attempt to amend the bill with their own alternative motion to guarantee ""full access"" to European markets after Brexit from outside the EEA. This was defeated by 322 votes to 240..MPs quit Labour roles over Brexit voteSNP MPs walk out of PMQs in protestWestminster sausage machineBy political editor Laura KuenssbergA wiser head than me - there's dispute over whether it was Mark Twain or Bismarck! - once remarked that laws are like sausages, if you respect them it's best not to watch them being made.Well the last 48 hours in Westminster may give weight to that. Farce? Fiasco? Or maybe today in Parliament has been in the best tradition of British pantomime.Or perhaps, this is in fact the completely predictable agony of split political parties, with leaders who struggle to command their troops, just trying to make it through after a huge vote that by its very nature, split the country in two.Read more from LauraWhy were MPs voting about Brexit?The government is trying to pass a new law, called the EU Withdrawal Bill, which it says is needed to ensure a ""smooth and orderly Brexit"".Its main purposes are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit.But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy.MPs also overturned other changes made to the bill by the Lords, including a requirement for ministers to set out steps to negotiate a customs union with the EU.The government agreed a compromise with potential Tory rebels earlier this week to work towards a ""customs arrangement"" with the EU. This won the support of the Commons by 325 votes to 298.Other changes insisted upon by the Lords relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, principles of EU law to be retained after Brexit and EU environmental principles were also removed.  In response to the votes, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable accused Labour of conspiring with the Conservatives to ""wave through a hard Brexit"".But ministers did make one significant policy concession - on refugee policy after Brexit.They accepted a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper to widen the terms under which unaccompanied child refugees can be reunited with family members living in the UK.

Because it extends the trend of Labour marching forward and Conservative gloom.The results underline the current likelihood, if the mood of the electorate does not shift, of Labour winning the general election.But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is going out of his way to avoid even the merest whiff of complacency. More to do despite by-election wins, says StarmerCurtice: By-elections leave Tories 'with mountain to climb' Could Reform surge sink Tory election hopes?Despite the massive swings to Labour, he told BBC Breakfast his party were merely ""credible contenders"" at the general election. The added political spice that garnishes the Tory gloom today is the performance of Reform UK.I'm typing this in a café in Wellingborough, in Northamptonshire, where this morning Reform candidate and deputy leader Ben Habib has been on a victory lap.Mr Habib finished third behind the Labour and the Conservative candidates, but it represents a victory in Reform's battle for influence, as they inflicted two very painful statistical wounds on Rishi Sunak's party.PA MediaReform candidate Ben Habib can't hide his delightReform got a 13% share of the vote at this by-election, in line with some national opinion polls that some thought might be flattering the party.And in Kingswood, near Bristol, they got a share of the vote greater than the gap between the victorious Labour candidate and the Tory runner-up.That is a double dose of the heebie-jeebies delivered in one day to nervous Tories.Perhaps little wonder that my phone pinged first thing with a text from one of those of Conservatives convinced of the party's imminent doom unless something radical changes, perhaps getting rid of Rishi Sunak.""The reality is Labour are currently storming to a huge victory and we have an insurgent party on the right polling above 10%. Cue Nigel Farage's intervention two months out from a general election and we're facing an extinction level event. It's a slow-motion car crash.""But as things stand I don't detect a mass, wider outbreak of insurrection. At least not yet.Joe GiddensLabour's Gen Kitchen celebrates her victory with supportersOne senior figure, loyal to the prime minister, pointed to the remarks of Jacob Rees Mogg, a cabinet minister under Liz Truss, who said Mr Sunak's ""leadership is solid and has support and by elections don't change that."" Let's see.Instead, I detected a near resigned rationality to the near inevitability of these results from Tory insiders. A heavy-hearted but practical conclusion based on the fact that by-elections are expensive if you properly go for it - around £100,000 a piece.In seats where it is close to impossible to shift the public mood it makes sense not to waste time and money.And so the Conservatives didn't. Their campaigning footprint was minimal in Northamptonshire, if a little larger in Kingswood.One Tory backbencher, whose private reflections I sought on the results, replied with the crying laughter emoji, followed by ""I'm an optimist.""The best the Conservatives can hope for is that by the autumn the economy is looking up, and inflation and interest rates are coming down.By-elections, particularly those mid-term, can often be mood makers or even weather changers when it comes to the political climate.But these two, as close as they are to the general election and as in line with existing and increasingly established trends as they are, feel like they reinforce a collection of sentiments already there.Make no mistake though: they are extraordinary results for Labour, a party crushed just five years ago, who now look as close to government as they have been in nearly a decade-and-a-half.Conservative PartyKeir StarmerRishi SunakLabour Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68316527"

It is understood Labour's chief whip Sir Alan Campbell spoke to him after PMQs and asked him to apologise.Mr Ali added: ""While I do not resile from my strongly held views on the situation in the Middle East, I would like to apologise for the way in which I described the prime minister in my question"".""We all have a responsibility to be respectful in the language that we use, even when discussing difficult and, at times, sensitive issues.""Israel launched its bombing and ground offensive in Gaza with the declared aim of destroying Hamas, after its gunmen killed around 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in an unprecedented attack in October.At least 25,700 people have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Correction 13th February: This article wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7th October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200.

And as Prime Minister's Questions got under way in the Commons, it still was not clear whether an announcement was coming. It was not until just after 17:00 BST that the UK's first July election since 1945 was confirmed.The prime minister referred to the inflation figures as he announced the election date in Downing Street later in the day, in a sign he hopes to frame his campaign around a narrative of economic recovery after a period of rising living costs. He added that the fall in inflation, along with the UK's emergence from recession earlier this year, were ""proof that the plan and priorities"" he had set out were working.1:13Henry Zeffman: How MPs turned to BBC for clarity on election gossipBut his statement did not go entirely to plan, as he battled worsening rain and activists blasting out New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better over a loudspeaker.

"26 February 2024","SNP to push for fresh Gaza debate after Commons vote chaos","SNP to push for fresh Gaza debate after Commons vote chaos26 February 2024SharePaul SeddonPolitics reporter, BBC NewsShareUK ParliamentSNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn declared no confidence in the Commons Speaker after this week's chaosThe SNP says it will push for another Commons debate on Gaza following the chaotic vote on the conflict on Wednesday.There was uproar in the Commons when Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle allowed MPs to vote on a Labour amendment to the SNP's ceasefire motion.It meant the SNP motion was not voted on, prompting the party to say Sir Lindsay should quit as Speaker.The SNP now says it will apply for another debate on the issue this week.Sir Lindsay, who has apologised for his handling of the debate, has already indicated he would allow a fresh debate under emergency rules.This could prove awkward for Labour, which has been plagued by division over its stance on the Israel-Hamas war.Labour has been accused of having warned Sir Lindsay that he would lose the party's support for him continuing as Speaker after a general election, if he did not allow a vote on its amendment. But the party denies such claims. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Labour shadow minister Lisa Nandy said she could assure people that no one from her party had threatened Sir Lindsay.""The idea that any political leader or any politician of any party could threaten the House of Commons Speaker and get away with it is just absolute nonsense,"" Ms Nandy said.""I certainly didn't, the chief whip didn't, the leader of the Labour party didn't,"" she added.How the row over Commons Speaker unfoldedWhat does the Speaker of the House of Commons do?Speaker's decision on Gaza vote concerning - PMWhy are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?However, it is unclear whether another debate will allow the SNP to force a vote that drives a wedge between other parties on the issue. In a statement, it said it wanted to have an emergency debate on a motion setting out ""concrete actions"" the UK could take to promote a ceasefire at the United Nations.The party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said this would allow MPs to ""move the debate forward"" by putting pressure on the government to take a firmer pro-ceasefire stance.The SNP said it wanted to do this through a little-used Commons procedure that allows emergency debates to take place at short notice.But Commons rules suggest the process allows only for a vote on a neutral motion, where MPs simply state they have generally considered an issue rather than making a decision.The SNP will have to formally apply for the debate after the Commons returns on Monday, potentially prompting fresh scrutiny over Sir Lindsay's handling of Commons procedure.Heightened scrutinyAhead of last Wednesday's debate, the SNP motion called for an ""immediate ceasefire""; Labour demanded an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", while the government had also tabled its own amendment calling for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"".Both Conservatives and SNP MPs were angered by the speaker who broke with convention and allowed a vote on a Labour amendment.The government then withdrew from taking part in the vote in protest, meaning Labour's amendment was waved through and the SNP's motion - which was meant to be the entire focus of the day - wasn't formally voted on at all. Sir Lindsay argued that letting MPs vote on a wider range of positions would protect them from threats to their safety, amid heightened scrutiny of their stance on the conflict.But it allowed Labour to sidestep a potentially damaging rebellion over whether it supported the wording of the SNP's ceasefire call, which also criticised the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"".Labour's own amendment supported a ceasefire but noted that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"".This prompted accusations Sir Lindsay had played ""party politics"" with the vote, with 77 MPs since declaring no confidence in him as speaker.The SNP said it would hold discussions with Sir Lindsay before publishing the motion it wants to see debated. He has already said he backs the idea of holding a further debate.However, if the SNP tables a motion detailing a range of specific demands on the government, it could put Sir Lindsay in an awkward position.His predecessor, John Bercow, prompted an outcry in 2019 by allowing MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit to use such an emergency debate to take control of the Commons timetable.This was seen as another controversial break with convention, by allowing an emergency debate to pave the way for MPs to make a binding decision.Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?How the row over Commons Speaker unfoldedHouse of CommonsLindsay HoyleIsrael-Gaza warLabour PartySNP (Scottish National Party)","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68386330"

The Speaker later apologised, saying he had acted ""with the right intentions"".But the SNP said they had been ""treated with complete and utter contempt"".Labour's amendment went through to loud shouts of ""aye"" without a formal vote, after the government said it would not take part in protest. This meant there was no vote on the SNP's motion, which called for an ""immediate ceasefire"", and was originally meant to be the focus of the debate.The government does not have to adopt Labour's position as the vote is not binding. Labour calls for Gaza immediate humanitarian ceasefireWhy are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?In extraordinary scenes, SNP MPs and some Tories walked out of the chamber over the Speaker's handling of the vote.Following calls for him to return to explain his decision, Sir Lindsay told the Commons he chose to allow a vote on the Labour motion so MPs could express their view on ""the widest range of propositions"". Amid shouts of resign, he said: ""I thought I was doing the right thing and the best thing, and I regret it, and I apologise for how it's ended up.""I do take responsibility for my actions, and that's why I want to meet with the key players who have been involved.""SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said whilst he acknowledged the Speaker's apology, Commons officials had warned the decision could lead to his party not having a vote, on a day which had been designated an SNP opposition day. Visibly furious, he said his party had been treated ""with complete and utter contempt"". ""I will take significant convincing that your position is not now intolerable,"" he added. In a statement after the debate, Mr Flynn said it was ""a disgrace that Sir Keir Starmer and the Speaker colluded to block Parliament voting on the SNP motion"". ""This should have been the chance for the UK Parliament to do the right thing and vote for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel - instead it turned into a Westminster circus,"" he added. UK ParliamentSir Lindsay returned to the chamber to apologise to MPsIt came after Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said Sir Lindsay had ""undermined the confidence"" of the House and suggested his decision had allowed the debate to be ""hijacked"" by Labour. She said this had ""has raised temperatures in this House on an issue where feelings are already running high"". Earlier, a source close to the Speaker said the suggestion he was pressurised was ""absolutely untrue"".Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and SNP of ""choosing political games over serious solutions"". ""Today was a chance for Parliament to unite and speak with one voice on the horrendous situation in Gaza and Israel,"" he said in a statement following the debate. Sir Lindsay was first elected as a Labour MP but after becoming Speaker he relinquished his party affiliation, as is the convention. While he said he would meet key MPs from the main parties to discuss what happened, intense pressure remains on the Speaker.More than 30 Tory and SNP MPs have declared they have no confidence in him by signing an early day motion. Very few early day motions are debated but they allow MPs to show their support for an issue. 0:26Hundreds queue to lobby MPs over Gaza ceasefire voteThe debate took place as thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square.Throughout the day, a long queue had formed outside the Commons, with protesters hoping to lobby MPs in person to support a ceasefire.Sir Lindsay's decision meant Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer avoided another potential rebellion over the party's position on Gaza as Labour MPs were able to show their support for a ceasefire without voting for an SNP motion. The motion went further than Labour's by calling for an end to the ""collective punishment of the Palestinian people"". Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy also argued it did not ""lay out a path to a sustainable peace"" and ""appears to be one-sided"". ""For any ceasefire to work it must by necessity be observed by all sides,"" he added. Labour's own amendment noted that Israel ""cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence"" and called for a diplomatic process to deliver ""a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable Palestinian state"". Last November Sir Keir suffered a major revolt when 56 of his MPs, including 10 frontbenchers, defied him to back an SNP motion urging an immediate ceasefire.Earlier this week, Labour shifted its position to call for ""an immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", following months of pressure from backbenchers and activists.The government is calling for ""an immediate humanitarian pause"", as well as supporting moves towards a ""permanent sustainable ceasefire"". Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage.Since then, Israel's military campaign has killed more than 29,000 people in Gaza, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Row after Commons Speaker picks Labour Gaza motionLabour calls for Gaza immediate humanitarian ceasefireWhy are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?Lindsay HoyleIsrael-Gaza warLabour PartySNP (Scottish National Party)","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68362405"
"7 December 2023","What is a vote of no confidence?","What is a vote of no confidence?7 December 2023ShareShareGetty ImagesPrime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing a potential leadership crisis, after Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick resigned over the government's plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Senior Conservative Party figures have told BBC News political editor Chris Mason they would not be surprised if Mr Sunak ended up facing a no-confidence vote from his own MPs.What is a no-confidence vote?It's a vote in which MPs from all parties decide whether they want the government to continue. It can trigger a general election and see a new prime minister appointed.While any MP can propose a no-confidence motion, there's no guarantee their request will be granted.However, if the leader of the opposition - currently Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - introduces the motion, convention means the government must provide parliamentary time for a debate.The wording is usually: ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.""The motion only needs a simple majority to pass: one more MP needs to vote in favour than the number voting against.If the government wins, it carries on as before. At present, the government has a majority of 58 in the House of Commons, so a lot of Conservative MPs would need to to vote against their own government for the motion to succeed. When is the next general election?What happens if the government loses?If the government loses, two things could happen.In normal circumstances, you would expect Parliament to be dissolved and a general election to be called.It is also possible that the King could invite somebody else to form a government - someone who could win a vote of confidence in the House of Commons.That would be very unusual. It last happened in January 1924, when Stanley Baldwin's Conservatives decided to assemble a new Parliament rather than resigning, after losing their majority in a general election.His government was defeated in a vote of no confidence and King George V asked Labour's Ramsay MacDonald -  leader of the second biggest party - to form a government instead.But almost a century later, it's not clear how that would work. Conservative MPs could agree on a different leader themselves, whom the King could then invite to form a new government.Getty ImagesRishi Sunak is the second prime minister of King Charles III's reignIn principle, the monarch could even refuse to dissolve Parliament for an election.Under the Lascelles principles (devised by Sir Alan Lascelles, private secretary to King George VI in 1950), the monarch could decline to do so if:the existing Parliament was still capable of doing its joba general election would be bad for the economyanother prime minister could be found who could get a majority in the House of CommonsBut these scenarios would put the monarch in a very difficult position, and it is not clear how they would play out.What does the King do? Would the PM have to resign?If the government loses a confidence vote, the situation is similar to that of an election in which no one party wins a majority.That means that the existing prime minister would only resign if it's clear someone else can command the support of the House of Commons.However, if an alternative government is ready to take over, convention suggests that the PM should stand down. But there is nothing clearly stated in law that says that they must do so. Failing to step down would risk bringing the King into the dispute, as the monarch appoints PMs and, in theory, can dismiss one who behaves unconstitutionally.

The PM said Mr Hester had apologised and his ""remorse should be accepted"".It has prompted a row over whether he should return the £10m Mr Hester has donated to the Conservative Party - something he said he will not do.In an article for the Guardian, Ms Abbott took aim at the Tories, arguing policies such as the Rwanda deportation scheme show they intend to play ""the race card"" as the next election approaches.But she also criticised Labour, insisting ""racism in politics is not just a matter for any one political party"". The article was published a day after Ms Abbott unsuccessfully tried more than 40 times to get the Speaker's attention so she could contribute to Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, which was dominated by the row.A spokesperson for the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said there was ""not enough time"" to call all MPs who wanted to speak.Abbott criticises Speaker for race row debate snubWe'd take more cash from race row Tory donor - ministerTory donor accused of racist Diane Abbott remarksMs Abbott sits as an independent MP after being suspended by Labour in April last year after she wrote in the Observer that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people were not subject to racism ""all their lives"".

"18 March 2024","Mood among Tory MPs darkens as Rishi Sunak faces leadership questions","Mood among Tory MPs darkens as Rishi Sunak faces leadership questions18 March 2024ShareHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentSharePA MediaThe mood in the Conservative Party is dark, and it has noticeably darkened over the past few days. Why? Last week was not a good week for Rishi Sunak, to say the least. First Lee Anderson, who had been suspended from the Conservative ranks over comments he made about Sadiq Khan, joined Reform, the insurgent right-wing party. Then came the reporting of alleged comments made by Frank Hester, a mega-donor to the Conservative Party. Generally Conservative MPs seem content with Mr Sunak's decision to keep hold of the £10m he gave the party last year, but there is definite frustration at the prime minister's handling of the revelations, especially the initial decision not to condemn the reported comments as racist. But there are more fundamental reasons that the vibe appears to have shifted among Conservatives. One is the state of the opinion polls. Conservative MPs can see the same polls as the public. They suggest that their party is headed not just for a defeat at the general election but for a very, very bad defeat. Many MPs, even those who have long reconciled themselves to the strong possibility of defeat, had thought that the gap with the Labour Party would have narrowed by now. There's also frustration that the Budget earlier this month appeared to do nothing to affect the polls. One former minister said they had seen the Budget as the ""last big needle mover"" - but that despite a significant personal tax cut, nothing appeared to have changed. National Insurance contributions were cut by 2% in the Budget but tax thresholds were frozen, leaving many people paying more in income tax.While the prime minister last week ruled out a general election on 2 May, there are still local elections in many parts of the country on that day. This means MPs are beginning to ramp up campaigning in their local areas. One Conservative MP - a supporter of Mr Sunak's leadership - said they were struck by the extent to which the prime minister ""is a drag"" on their vote when mentioned on the doorstep. Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?Lee Anderson defection lends momentum to Reform UKPM pressured over new funds from racism accused donorThe local election campaign trail also appears to be focusing minds on what a general election might look like. Some were heartened by reports last week that Boris Johnson will campaign for the Conservatives at the election.For others, this just underscored their frustrations with the current leader. ""Who do you want coming off the battle bus in your marginal seat, Boris or Rishi?"" one MP has been asking their colleagues. (To be clear, it's a rhetorical question - their answer is not Rishi).The mutterings - and for now they are just that - about the leadership have focused so far on Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons. We know that she would like to be leader of the Conservative Party: after all, she tried to become leader twice in 2022. Few Conservatives are giving much credence to the idea that there is an advanced plot, anchored by an alliance of Ms Mordaunt's supporters and those on the right of the party. But that doesn't mean the possibility isn't of interest to MPs. ""I don't think it's coming from Penny,"" one senior MP said. ""But I think it's a fairly credible idea.""Others think the notion of removing Mr Sunak and installing a fifth Conservative leader in five years is absurd. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour last night Damian Green, Theresa May's former deputy, said: ""All I can say is that nobody's spoken to me about Penny Mordaunt or anyone else like that, so I think there are people claiming that things are happening that I know are not happening."" He added: ""I think we've had enough prime ministers for this parliament thank you very much.""One senior minister was more pithy. ""Mental,"" was their one-word take on the idea of replacing the prime minister again. This morning Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary,  appeared to acknowledge that a ""small minority"" of MPs are agitating, but told them to ""stop it"". Mr Sunak is in Coventry today talking about the economy, arguing that a corner is being turned. That reflects the political message to his MPs too: hold your nerve. It is certainly possible that the political mood could feel different for him by the end of this week. The Rwanda bill, designed to put the government's flagship asylum policy on a stronger legal footing, could be law by the end of this week. Inflation statistics may show a significant drop on Wednesday, paving the way for a possible interest rates cut. Then early next week MPs break for Easter, meaning they will not be able to plot in person together for at least a few weeks. So if there is to be a crunch leadership moment, most MPs seem to think it would come after the local elections. Yet some wonder if the bleak atmosphere right now is sustainable up to that point.""I think the party has just about had it,"" one senior Conservative figure, a firm supporter of the prime minister, said. ""There's a realisation that there's nothing good left.""Update 11 April 2024: This article was amended to include extra context about tax thresholds being frozen in the Budget as well as NI contributions being cut.Conservative PartyRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68597115"
"21 July 2023","By-elections: Little comfort for Tories in bad night at the polls","By-elections: Little comfort for Tories in bad night at the polls21 July 2023ShareChris MasonPolitical editor, BBC NewsShare0:41We've got to double down and stick to our plan - SunakThis set of by-elections amounts to a single question: just how badly did the Conservatives do? The answer - very badly. But not as badly as they had feared. The prospect of a crushing three-nil defeat - beaten everywhere - was averted. Labour managed to win - and win really big - in rural North Yorkshire; the kind of spot some distance from usually fertile political territory for them. And yet they lost in north west London, where they had expected to win.But, but, but: the Tory obliteration in Somerset will sow panic among many Conservatives in the south west of England.So let's unpick where this leaves us, because on the face of it is a rather messy picture.Live: Follow latest by-election reaction and analysisNext election not lost, says Sunak after defeatsBig defeats for Tories but party holds UxbridgeTo what extent were these contests atypical, by-election quirks rather than true indicators of the national mood?Firstly, Labour's victory in Selby and Ainsty is off the scale big.1:24Sir Keir Starmer on by-election win: Starmer: ""First time I have been able to say: Well done Keir""Another Keir joins the ranks of Labour MPs, Keir Mather. It's a name rich in Labour history: Keir Hardie was the party's first leader.If Labour won on this scale nationally, they would be in government with a colossal majority.But hang on a minute.The party that has campaigned so fruitfully for so long on the perceived failings of Boris Johnson has failed to take Uxbridge and South Ruislip, the very seat he used to represent.Just days ago, the Conservatives were ready to blame what they described privately as ""Long Boris"" to explain away their losses.In other words, don't blame us, blame the prime minister before last.But now they have won where he was the MP, and lost in two places where he wasn't. Downing Street had not anticipated a photo opportunity where smiles would feature today.But before some of us had reached for the breakfast cereal Rishi Sunak was beaming in Uxbridge.And his message is one we will keep hearing, I suspect: the general election is not a done deal, and where voters see what he will claim is the ""reality of Labour"" they vote Conservative.To hear Conservatives this morning talking about Uxbridge was to hear those swimming through the roughest of rough political seas, and then seeing an unlikely raft upon which to climb, and breathe a brief sigh of relief.Labour are disappointed to lose in Uxbridge.Publicly, and more candidly in private, they blame the expansion of London's Ultra Low Emissions Zone (Ulez), a policy idea blamed by many voters on the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.""If you run on a ticket about the cost of living but you are blamed for adding 90 quid a week to the cost of living for some, it's going to be difficult,"" acknowledged one party figure.The Ulez daily charge is £12.50 a day. If a driver fails to pay the charge, or broke the penalty charge rules, the bill could be higher.Labour's failure to take Uxbridge presents three niggles for the party, as they look to the general election: How vulnerable are they to targeted, single issue campaigns?What does that say about the depth of support for Sir Keir Starmer?And how might rival parties capitalise in parts of the UK where Labour are seen as the party of power - such as London and Wales?Equally, if you are one of the innumerable Labour figures desperate to not sound complacent, losing in Uxbridge rather helps. And what about the Liberal Democrats?Their win in Somerton and Frome was huge.The Lib Dem leader stages a cannon stunt to celebrate his party winning the Somerton and Frome by-electionThey hope it is proof of a revival in the West Country, a former heartland for the party before the near oblivion that followed their years in coalition at Westminster.And there is plenty of evidence of that revival: last year's by-election win in nearby Tiverton and Honiton and their control of Somerset Council for starters.But: they are a small party with limited resources.They threw everything at Somerton and Frome, managing to knock on 15,000 doors on polling day alone. That kind of operation is much harder to do at a general election - when they are likely to be trying to throw everything at around 30 seats, not just one.Privately, party figures acknowledge that this by-election campaign was helped hugely by former Conservative cabinet minister Nadine Dorries having not yet resigned her seat in Mid Bedfordshire, another Lib Dem target.Had that contest happened on Thursday too, it would have split their resources in half. At a general election, the demands on staffing would be even more brutal. But the party does now have ample evidence that they have overcome the paralysing hangover of the coalition years, and are competitive again - and dangerous, particularly to the Tories.Overall, the scope for Conservative comfort anywhere after these results is very slender. But not as slender as it might have been.

"9 December 2023","Rwanda: Tory MPs under pressure to back Rishi Sunak's plan","Rwanda: Tory MPs under pressure to back Rishi Sunak's plan9 December 2023ShareKate Whannel & Iain WatsonBBC NewsSharePA MediaTory MPs are coming under pressure from ministers to back the PM's Rwanda plan.Rishi Sunak hopes sending migrants to the African nation for processing and potential resettlement will deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats. He has introduced emergency legislation aimed at overcoming legal issues which have so far delayed the scheme.However, MPs from across his party have concerns about the approach and will be examining the bill over the weekend. Last month, Supreme Court judges blocked the government's original plan, declaring that Rwanda was not a safe country and that the asylum system was flawed. The government has now introduced the Safety of Rwanda Bill which requires judges to treat Rwanda as safe. It also gives ministers powers to disregard parts of the Human Rights Act, and prevents judges from taking into account other international laws. The main Tory factions jostling for influenceUK paid Rwanda an extra £100m for asylum dealCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Government ministers have been putting in calls to persuade MPs to vote for the bill on Tuesday, when it gets its second reading in the House of Commons.This stage of the process is usually reserved for debating the general points of the proposed law. MPs with concerns are likely to wait until later stages before trying to make changes to the draft legislation. But Mr Sunak is keen to avoid a defeat at the hands of Tory rebels and the Labour Party on a key part of his flagship ""stop the boats"" policy. Concerned Tory MPs are being offered meetings with government ministers.Those who have human rights concerns are being told not all of the Human Rights Act is being disapplied by the proposed law and that asylum seekers facing serious irreversible harm could still challenge a decision to be deported, based on their individual cases. However, MPs on the right of the party are being reassured that such legal challenges would be unlikely to succeed.Both former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and former immigration minister Robert Jenrick have said Mr Sunak's plan will not work.Mr Jenrick resigned his ministerial job shortly after the Safety of Rwanda Bill was published arguing that it did not go far enough. In an article in Saturday's Daily Telegraph, Mr Jenrick says he does not believe the Rwanda law will work, and calls for the UK to ""extricate"" itself from ""complex international frameworks"" and ""outdated treaties"". The bill in its current form would still allow migrants to challenge their removal to Rwanda, and would not exclude individual appeals from the European Court of Human Rights, he says. ""The idea, therefore, that this Bill will guarantee all those arriving are detained and swiftly removed is for the birds,"" he wrote.He also suggested the Conservatives will face the ""red-hot fury of voters"" unless they do more to tackle the number of people moving to the UK.  'Dogs are cats' The European Research Group, an influential body of pro-Brexit MPs, have said they are studying the bill ""forensically"" but some are concerned the bill still allows for individuals to appeal a decision to deport them to Rwanda.On the other side of the party, the One Nation group of MPs are taking legal advice from former Solicitor General Lord Garnier.He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the legislation was ""political nonsense and legal nonsense"".""It's trying to define things when there is no evidence for that being the case. It's rather like a bill that has decided that all dogs are cats.""Lord Garnier sits in the House of Lords, where the bill is also likely to run into difficulties.Speaking on Wednesday, Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta said: ""It has always been important to both Rwanda and the UK that our rule of law partnership meets the highest standards of international law.""He added that ""without lawful behaviour by the UK"" Rwanda would not be able to continue with the agreement.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster he supported the policy, saying: ""It's expensive, but the truth is it won't be expensive if it works.""I don't know whether it'll work... but I think we have to try it.""He also suggested some of criticism of the policy ""comes out of leadership manoeuvrings"".He warned his colleagues not to put their ""leadership ambitions"" ahead of the interests of the Conservative Party or the country.The full interview will be available to listen to at 11am on Saturday 9 December on Radio 4 and afterwards on BBC Sounds.Sunak’s Rwanda law at mercy of Tory factionsCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?Robert JenrickSuella BravermanRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67659420"
"21 March 2024","Rwanda flights: Lords inflict further defeats on government","Rwanda flights: Lords inflict further defeats on government21 March 2024ShareBecky MortonBBC political reporterShareGetty ImagesThe House of Lords has inflicted fresh defeats on the government over its flagship Rwanda bill, meaning further delay to it becoming law.Seven proposed changes, including a provision to ensure ""due regard"" for domestic and international law, were passed by peers.The bill will now return to the Commons, but not until after Easter.The legislation aims to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda.It declares the east African country is safe, after deportation flights were stalled by the Supreme Court ruling the government's plan could lead to human rights breaches.The scheme is central to the prime minister's pledge to ""stop the boats"" as it seeks to deter people from making the dangerous journey across the Channel. What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Labour's proposals on domestic and international law were passed by 271 to 228 votes.Opposing the amendment, Home Office Minister Lord Sharpe insisted there was nothing in the bill which conflicts with the UK's international obligations. Meanwhile, peers also supported a proposal put forward by crossbench peer Lord Hope that Rwanda only be deemed a safe country once a treaty bringing in new safeguards has been fully implemented. The amendment passed by 285 to 230 votes. Another change to exempt individuals who have supported the UK armed forces overseas from deportation to Rwanda, which was proposed by Labour peer Lord Browne, was passed by 248 to 209 votes. The bill must now return to the Commons in a process known as ""ping pong"", where it is batted between the two Parliamentary chambers until they can agree the final wording. This is now expected to happen after MPs return from their Easter break on 15 April, according to a senior government source.Labour's Home Affairs spokesman Lord Coaker said the party had no intention of blocking the bill completely. However, a delay could threaten Downing Street's ambition to get the first flights off the ground this spring. No 10 officials insist that even if the legislation is not passed until after Easter, their target date can still be met. On Monday, MPs voted down 10 amendments to the draft law proposed by peers earlier this month and they are likely to again reject any further changes put forward in the House of Lords. Home Office Minister Michael Tomlinson has described the proposals put forward by peers as ""wrecking amendments"".Ahead of the Lords debate, Home Secretary James Cleverly urged peers to allow the bill to pass. ""The more this bill progresses, the more worried Labour get that, as we've always said, it will work and the more we've anticipated deliberate efforts from Labour to delay, disrupt or sabotage the scheme,"" he told the Daily Express. ""We remain focused on not letting that happen, and hope their lordships recognise it's time to let this bill pass so we can continue to stop the boats, and save lives.""Labour's Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the Rwanda scheme was ""a failing farce"". ""If the Conservatives were ready to implement this, they would be bringing the bill back to complete the remaining stages next week and get on with it,"" she said.""But because their plans aren't ready, they've decided to delay the bill as well, so they can try to blame everyone else for the chaos they have created, and the fact that they haven't got a proper plan."" Labour has said it would scrap the Rwanda scheme if it wins power, even if flights take off before the next general election. However, asked if any individuals already sent to the country would be returned to the UK under a Labour government, a party spokesman said they would not, adding: ""If the scheme is up and running you have to accept the decisions the government has already made.""Lords inflict more defeats on Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68618570"

What does this tell us about British politics?Four of the eight Conservative MPs who made it through to the first round of voting are women, and five - Rishi Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi, Suella Braverman, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat - are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Mr Zahawi was voted out in the first round, along with Jeremy Hunt, and Ms Braverman was knocked out in Thursday's second round.Before Sajid Javid and Rehman Chishti dropped out, a third of the Conservative Party's 22 non-white MPs were bidding to be its next leader.In a matter of weeks, the Conservatives could elect only the third national leader from an ethnic minority in Western Europe, after former Irish premier Leo Varadkar, whose parents are white Irish and Indian, and the first, Antonio Costa the prime minister of Portugal whose parents are half Portuguese and half Indian from Goa.This is quite a turnaround for a party that was historically seen as an exclusively white domain, but it did not happen by accident.Who could be the next prime minister?When will we know who the new PM is?What do the Conservative campaign videos reveal?It is largely the product of a 17-year long effort to increase the diversity of Conservative MPs, launched by former leader David Cameron.When Mr Cameron was elected leader in 2005, the party had just two ethnic minority MPs, both men. 'Time has come'In the teeth of opposition from traditionally-minded colleagues, he created an A-list of diverse candidates for winnable seats, saying he wanted to make the party more representative of modern Britain.Rob Ford, professor of political science at Manchester University, said Mr Cameron ""deserves credit"" for persuading local Conservative associations to adopt diverse candidates, whether they were on the A-list or not.The fact that many have risen rapidly through the ranks, into cabinet positions and are now leadership contenders, is no accident either, he argues.""Cameron wasn't just looking for anyone off the street. They were looking to get really impressive, high flying people from diverse backgrounds.""There is a sense that ""their time has come"", argues Professor Ford. ""They are not just seeing themselves as the right people for this moment, they are being seen by colleagues as right for the moment.""All of those vying to be the next Tory leader have tried to project a compelling personal story - but none have so far made an issue of their race. 'Identity politics'Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is not among the contenders, said: ""I have always found in the Conservative Party that people were less bothered about where you come from, in terms of your ethnic background, your social background, than they were, for example, in the Labour Party, or in other parties.""He argues that the Conservatives are a ""individualistic"" party where people ""take you as they find you"" and are not interested in ""identity politics"".""I don't understand why it is incumbent on ethnic politicians to represent their race in a way that it isn't incumbent on other people of the majority population. No one says 'he is a white politician, he is representing me'.""The Conservative Party still lags behind Labour when it comes to ethnic minority representation at Westminster. A record number of 41 black, Asian and minority ethnic Labour MPs were elected in 2019, and there are now more female Labour MPs than men for the first time.Ethnic minority voters still overwhelmingly vote Labour, according to House of Commons library research. Analysis of the 2010 general election, by Oxford University's Professor Anthony Heath, suggested minorities were not as ""progressive"" in their political views as white British voters, but backed Labour ""because of belief, based on collective experience, that Labour looks after ethnic minorities while the Conservatives do not"".The Conservatives have gained a little ground since 2010 - with 20% of black and minority ethnic voters backing them at the 2019 general election, according to pollsters Ipsos.That support may grow with a black or Asian Tory prime minister. 'Racist policies'But many on the left argue that the colour of those in the cabinet, or even at the helm of the party, is irrelevant, as the Conservatives have harmed race relations in the UK.They point to the Windrush scandal, plans to deport illegal immigrants to Rwanda, and an ongoing investigation into Islamophobia in the party, as evidence of deep-rooted discrimination.In a 2020 interview with The Independent, former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott claimed the government was in ""denial"" about systemic racial prejudice within the police, immigration services and the criminal justice system. Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City university, said: ""It is the most diverse government in history, but it also has the most racist policies of any government.""He argues that black and Asian Conservative ministers are essentially ""fronts for white oppression"", saying they are able to introduce policies that white political leaders would not be able to get away with.There is also the question of social class. The race to be the next PM may be diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity, but most of the contenders fit the traditional Tory profile of well-off, privately educated and from comfortable middle class homes.Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London, said: ""I do worry that the group that is most missing from Parliament - and most missing from this leadership contest - will be people who come from backgrounds that many people would identify with, and are considered ordinary.""There's no denying that Parliament is now more visibly representative of the country - and this Conservative leadership contest reflects that evolution. And having a prime minister of colour would undoubtedly be an important milestone in British politics.But the question of representation is a thorny and complex one.Some might feel inspired to see someone who looks like them in a position of power and feel more invested in the government of the day.Others might be put off by wealth, private education, an elite university degree - or any other experience they can't relate to.And still others might see no need for a prime minister to have a similar background to them, so long as they can deliver policies that make a positive impact.Whoever wins this race will be drawing from all different parts of their identity and life story to determine what policies to pursue in office.Conservative PartyNadhim ZahawiSuella BravermanRishi SunakRace and ethnicity","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-62150063"
"4 May 2024","Tory rebels back off Sunak coup despite election losses","Tory rebels back off Sunak coup despite election losses4 May 2024ShareHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentShareReutersHere's two observations about the local election results. First: The results have been pretty dismal for the Conservatives, with some limited exceptions, pointing the way to a Labour victory at the general election. Second: Speaking to Conservative MPs, advisers and officials, any threat to Rishi Sunak's leadership appears to be fading fast. To some, that's a paradox. The results so far indicate that the Conservatives are heading for defeat under Mr Sunak's leadership.Why not, then, change leader? Yet there are still only two MPs who have publicly called for a change of leader - with no-one new joining that rebel band in response to these results. For another group of Conservative MPs, the possibility of ousting yet another leader in such a short timeframe is too absurd even to mention. Both sides agree that as it stands the prospect of a challenge to the prime minister's authority is receding. ""He'll survive,"" one frustrated rebel declared shortly after Ben Houchen's victory in the Tees Valley mayoral contest was confirmed. John Curtice: Conservatives remain in deep electoral troubleChris Mason: A rough night for the ConservativesCould Reform UK surge sink Tory election hopes?What are the main takeaways?Key results in maps and chartsWhen is the next general election?That mayoral victory - plus what is generally expected to be a Conservative hold tomorrow in the West Midlands too - should not be underestimated psychologically for MPs. ""We need something positive to point to,"" a senior ally of Mr Sunak said as the counting got underway on Thursday. ""If we have no positive then it's all rather tricky.""After a morning of unrelenting gloom, the Tees Valley became that positive totem - little wonder that Mr Sunak rushed there for an event with Lord Houchen. To some, this is baffling. Lord Houchen's vote fell substantially, albeit from an extraordinarily high starting point - a swing that would make every Conservative MP in the region very nervous indeed if replicated at a general election.But politics is psychology as well as psephology. Seeing a popular independent-minded local incumbent defy a national trend is compelling for MPs, some of whom believe they have strong personal votes even if there is little academic evidence for that. ""The thing I notice from not just the mayoralties but some of the council results is that people who have been able to build a personal connection with voters and a personal brand are outperforming the trend,"" one minister said. ""People are looking at that and thinking - if I do everything I might just hold on. That may or may not be true, but that's how they'll interpret it.""1:26On a poor night for the Conservatives in local elections, Ben Houchen is returned as the mayor of the Tees Valley.To be clear, most Conservatives remain profoundly gloomy about the party's prospects at the general election. One influential Conservative, explaining why there was now, they believed, ""almost zero"" chance of Mr Sunak being challenged, said that the results ""confirm we're on track for a trashing""... but not an ""extinction level"" event. Not everyone is completely writing off the possibility that Mr Sunak could come under threat. One minister described a ""relative silence"" not only on the airwaves but also in some of the notorious party WhatsApp groups, saying this suggested that many were still adopting a ""wait and see approach"". The minister added: ""Things often move quickly despite calm in the immediate aftermath of results.""The Labour Party, meanwhile, are professing to be extremely satisfied, not just with the overnight results, but with the way the debate in the Conservative Party is developing. ""If they want to kid themselves that the mayoral results mean they should keep Rishi Sunak in place,"" one senior Labour source said, ""then they can be our guests.""Sunak 'disappointed' over local election lossesSeven takeaways from the local electionsConservative PartyMayor of the Tees ValleyRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68950272"

A website to express an interest in being a sponsor will launch on Monday.Mr Gove also told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme the government was looking at using the properties of Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the UK for ""humanitarian purposes"" but there was ""quite a high legal bar"" and this measure would lapse as sanctions ended.Retailers Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons are among the UK companies offering to employ Ukrainian refugees. Asos said it wanted to attract Ukraine's strong technology engineering skill set, while soap shop Lush said it would open up internal vacancies to refugees.Addressing a rally outside Downing Street on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, called for more support, weapons and humanitarian assistance.War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbySANCTIONS: Impact on everyday lives in RussiaEXIT: Russia faces brain drain as thousands flee abroadRECRUITS: Ukraine's teenage soldiersIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflictLocal authorities will also receive £10,500 in extra funding per refugee for support services - with more for children of school age, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said.More than 2.5 million people have so far fled Ukraine because of Russia's invasion, in what the UN has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War Two.The government has faced criticism - including from its own MPs - over the speed and scale of its response.Defending the government's response, Mr Gove told the BBC the number of Ukrainians fleeing the war who had been granted visas had now risen to 3,000. Getty ImagesThere is no sign of any end to the war in Ukraine, now in its 18th dayAt the moment, only those fleeing the conflict who have family connections in the UK are able to make an application via the Ukraine Family Scheme. Other visas are available but application centres in Ukraine are closed.Under the new scheme sponsors in the UK will not be required to know the refugees in advance and there will be no limit on numbers. Ukrainians on the scheme will be given leave to remain for three years, with the right to work and access public services.Mr Gove told the BBC that he anticipated ""tens of thousands"" of Ukrainians might be taken in by UK families with the first arrivals ""within a week"".0:12On the Bafta 2022 red carpet, Stephen Graham and Benedict Cumberbatch were seen wearing Ukraine-coloured badges Applications will be made online, with both sponsors being vetted and refugees having to go through security checks. The sponsor will get a ""thank you"" payment of £350 a month.Asked if he would take a Ukrainian refugee into his home, Mr Gove said ""yes"" and that he was ""exploring what I can do"".""Without going into my personal circumstances, there are a couple of things I need to sort out - but yes,"" he added.In a later phase of the scheme, organisations such as charities and churches will also be able to sponsor refugees, though there is no start date for this yet.Two weeks since it was announced, we now have some details of the scheme allowing people to host refugees in their homes. The idea is a simple one, but the practicalities of matching those fleeing Russia's invasion with willing households in the UK won't be easy. Aiming to place people with hosts within a fortnight is ambitious and the system is untested. Ministers are keen to avoid using hotels or other temporary accommodation used by Afghans last year, and are adamant that security checks should stay in place on those fleeing Ukraine.But for some Conservative MPs, let alone Labour and other opposition parties, the government's response has fallen short. And it's no accident that Michael Gove - and not the Home Secretary Priti Patel - is fronting the latest efforts to smooth out and speed up the process of settling people in the UK. What ministers have described as a cross-government approach has looked at times like inter-departmental wrangling over who's best placed to get things done. The Refugee Council - a charity supporting refugees and asylum seekers in the UK - said it was concerned people from Ukraine were facing further ""bureaucratic hurdles"", and the government scheme fell short of what was needed.Claiming formal refugee status, or permission to stay for humanitarian reasons through the asylum system, does not require a visa and allows an applicant and their dependants to stay in the UK for five years, with the right to work, study and apply for benefits.Why I want to share my home with a Ukrainian refugeeFor the third time in a year, John Rutherford and his wife Sue are considering opening up their south London house to a refugee.""We have a big house, my kids have left home,"" says John. ""It's not a great hardship for us to make some space for a refugee.""John RutherfordJohn Rutherford and his wife have previously hosted refugees from Ethiopia and IranIn 2021, they hosted one person from Ethiopia and one from Iran, each for a couple of weeks while they awaited longer-term accommodation during the asylum application process.And now, he is ready to open his five-bedroom house again.""It was the sheer numbers involved that made me want to help... there could be four or five million people looking for places to stay, so the UK has to do its bit and the British people have to do their bit.""Read moreLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News the government's visa schemes have been ""too slow, too narrow, too mean"", adding that the government had not consulted local councils about the support that needs to be put in place.""Frankly the last few weeks have been an embarrassment to the United Kingdom in terms of refugees,"" he said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said Home Secretary Priti Patel should be sacked for the government's response to Ukrainian refugees.""The incompetence, indifference and sheer inhumanity we have seen from the home secretary does not befit our United Kingdom, with its proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need,"" he told the party's spring conference in York.A government spokesperson responded to Sir Ed's comments by saying ""the facts do not support these accusations"", and repeating a claim that the UK had ""resettled more refugees through safe and legal routes than any other European country"" since 2015.As BBC Reality Check reported this week, while this specific claim is true, the overall picture is very different - as some other European countries have taken in far more refugees than the UK since 2015.The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have written to the UK government to propose that their nations go further with the new scheme.The European Union is allowing Ukrainians three-year residency without a visa, but the UK says controls on entry are essential for security. Ireland takes in 5,500 Ukrainian refugeesWales ready to welcome 1,000 Ukrainian refugeesThe Republic of Ireland's prime minister Micheal Martin told the BBC's Sunday Morning show that his country had taken in 5,500 Ukrainian refugees but had not carried out any security checks on entry.Meanwhile, celebrities including actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Graham have shown their support for Ukraine at the Bafta Awards 2022, under way in central London.People can welcome refugees into their homes - PMUK offers £350 a month to Ukrainian refugee hostsRussia-Ukraine warUK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersUkraineUkrainian refugees","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-60724111"

"25 February 2019","Brexit: MPs to have vote by 12 March, says May","Brexit: MPs to have vote by 12 March, says May25 February 2019ShareShareMay: Brexit deal ""within grasp"" for 29 MarchMPs will be able to have a fresh vote on the Brexit deal by 12 March, Prime Minister Theresa May has said.Speaking as she travelled to an EU-Arab League summit in Egypt, Mrs May ruled out holding another so-called ""meaningful vote"" this week.But she said ""positive"" talks with the EU were ""still ongoing"" and leaving on 29 March was ""within our grasp"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of ""recklessly running down the clock"".In a tweet, he said the move was intended to ""force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal"".Labour, he said, would ""work with MPs across the Commons to prevent no deal, break the deadlock and build support for our alternative plan"".Brexit must not be frustrated, May vowsCabinet trio issue Brexit delay warningBrexit: A really simple guideA lonely PM nears the Brexit endgameOn the plane to Sharm el-Sheikh for a summit between EU and Arab league leaders, Mrs May said her team would be returning to the Belgian capital on Tuesday for further talks. ""As a result of that, we won't bring a meaningful vote to Parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,"" she added. Mrs May has already met European Council President Donald Tusk for talks after landing in Egypt and will meet other EU leaders on the fringes of the summit later.She said negotiations were continuing over the backstop - the controversial policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - after Parliament voted for her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to what is set out in her deal. What does 12 March Brexit vote date tell us?It's true that playing for time is a powerful, if cynical, political strategy and the Labour Party - and lots of Conservatives too - are annoyed that Downing Street seems to be dragging its feet like this and won't give MPs a formal thumbs up or thumbs down vote for more than another fortnight.The prime minister naming the next vote day might do a little to calm the tempers of those in government who have been very publicly suggesting that strategy is madness. 12 March is at least, for them, before the next EU summit.It is not, as these things go, the final, final, moment. Reckless, many will suggest, but not a total kamikaze mission.But it won't stop the senior MPs Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, still pushing for a vote next week for their own bill that would force the government to delay Brexit if they don't have a deal in place by... guess when? 13 March. Oh look - the day AFTER Number 10's new deadline.Here, the date of 12 March suggests that the government is, as one source suggested, ""planning for every eventuality"".In other words - they think it's likely MPs might indeed vote this week to extend the process if a deal hasn't been done.Read Laura's blogMrs May also rejected an accusation - made last week by MP Anna Soubry as she quit the Conservative Party - that she had a ""personal problem"" with immigration. ""I have consistently said that immigration has been good for this country,"" the prime minister said, adding: ""It's important that we have welcomed people coming to the country over the years - both people migrating to the UK for work purposes but also crucially those many refugees and asylum seekers.""Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was 'worried' the prime minister had a problem with immigration.And she also made clear that she wants to stay on in Number 10 after the first phase of Brexit finishes, despite having promised her MPs she would not fight the next election.She said her job ""is not just about delivering Brexit"" and ""there is still a domestic agenda that I want to get on with.""'Unbelievable'Yvette Cooper called the latest delay ""utterly shambolic"", tweeting: ""Each time we get closer to cliff edge. How are businesses, public services and families supposed to plan in this chaos?"" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, also called the delay ""unacceptable"".And the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Adam Marshall, said it was ""unbelievable"" to leave the vote so close to the planned exit date.

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.Accept and continueWhat votes are happening this week?On Wednesday, MPs will get another chance to put forward a range of amendments to show what direction they want Brexit to take.  Top of the list is the Cooper-Letwin amendment - and cabinet ministers Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke wrote in the Daily Mail that they would be forced to back it if the pro-Leave European Research Group (ERG) - made up of Tory backbenchers - stood in the way of the withdrawal deal being agreed ""in the next few days"".The ERG would then have ""no-one to blame but themselves for delaying Brexit,"" the trio said.Environment Secretary Michael Gove has urged his cabinet colleagues against backing the Cooper-Letwin amendment, calling for ""unity"" behind the PM.  Gove: “I will do everything I can to persuade colleagues to stay in government.”Labour is also likely to table an amendment on Wednesday, putting its own Brexit plan - one which backs a permanent customs union with the EU and a close relationship with its single market - to MPs. While it's likely to be rejected, the moment could still be significant. The party's conference last September bound the leadership to explore all remaining alternatives to the PM's Brexit plan, including a public vote, if it wasn't able to force a general election. Efforts to get an election have failed, so if Labour's own Brexit plan is defeated in the Commons, the only remaining option would be a new referendum.Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that ""we are heading in that direction"", but ""there is still more play in the days ahead"".Mr Watson said the leadership was also looking at an amendment drawn up by two backbenchers, Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which would be tabled whenever the next meaningful vote is held.Under the terms of that amendment, Labour MPs would support the prime minister's Brexit deal in exchange for it then being put to a public vote.'Reassurance'Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned on Sunday that his government could not be asked to ""compromise on something as fundamental as the peace process"", on which the border played a key part.He accused the UK government of wanting to change the backstop to ""placate a group in the Conservative Party who are insisting on moving the prime minister away from her own policies"", and reiterated that the EU would not re-open the withdrawal agreement. But he told Sky News they would try to ""provide reassurance and clarification for the British Parliament to allow them to ratify this deal"".Speaking from the summit on Sunday, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it ""would be good to postpone Brexit"" if the deal was not agreed by the beginning of March.

The former Tory deputy chairman also criticised the party for not showing him a ""bit more backing"".PM Rishi Sunak called the Ashfield MP's comments wrong but avoided saying if he thought they were Islamophobic.Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's leader, said Mr Sunak lacked the ""backbone"" to call out Islamophobia.Mr Anderson says his attacks on Mr Khan were borne out of frustration at the London mayor's record.During a GB News discussion on Friday afternoon, Mr Anderson said: ""I don't actually believe that the Islamists have got control of our country, but what I do believe is they've got control of Khan and they've got control of London, and they've got control of Starmer as well.""He later added: ""People are just turning up in their thousands, and doing anything they want, and they are laughing at our police. This stems with Khan, he's actually given our capital city away to his mates.""Mr Anderson had been responding to a Daily Telegraph article by ex-Home Secretary Suella Braverman, in which she said: ""The truth is that the Islamists, the extremists and the antisemites are in charge now.""Ms Braverman said Islamists ""bullied the Labour Party"" over its position on the war in Gaza and that some people on pro-Palestinian marches had links to Islamists.

He argued pro-Palestinian protests outside Parliament and threats to MPs showed Mr Khan had ""lost control of the city"". He insisted his comments ""weren't racist at all"" and said he would not apologise to Mr Khan ""while I have a breath in my body"". Pressed over whether he would join the right-wing Reform UK party, the former Labour councillor declined to comment but said he had ""been on a political journey"". He said: ""You'll say Lee Anderson rules out/doesn't rule out joining the Reform party, so I'm making no comment on my future.""When asked if he would be a Tory candidate at the next election, Mr Anderson said ""that's not up to me"", but added that he would still be standing. Reform UK leader Richard Tice, also a GB News presenter, appeared to leave the door open to Mr Anderson on Monday, saying he ""may have been clumsy in his precise choice of words, but his sentiments are supported by millions of British citizens, including myself"".""I do not and will not give a running commentary on any discussions I have with any MPs, but those MPs have my number.""Speaking to reporters on Monday, Mr Sunak said Mr Anderson's choice of words ""wasn't acceptable, it was wrong, that's why the whip was suspended"".He said it was ""incumbent"" on parliamentarians not to inflame debate ""in a way that is harmful to others"".The prime minister also denied there were Islamophobic tendencies in his party.But Labour leader Sir Keir told reporters: ""This is really basic. Islamophobia is something which should be called out by every political leader, and the prime minister isn't calling it out because he's too weak.""In an Evening Standard article Mr Khan said Mr Anderson had ""poured petrol on the fires of hatred"". ""It shouldn't be hard to call out comments that are so unambiguously ignorant, prejudiced and racist. Yet those at the top of the Conservative government are stubbornly refusing to do so.""PA MediaSadiq Khan said Lee Anderson's comments should be called out as IslamophobicConservative MP Rehman Chishti, who is Muslim, called for the prime minister to appoint an independent adviser on Islamophobia, a position which has been vacant since June 2022. He told the BBC Mr Sunak had ""failed to engage"" with him on tackling Islamophobia and he had ""real concern with regards to the prime minister's judgement on these matters"". In 2019, the Conservative Party launched an inquiry into how the party handles discrimination claims, following allegations of Islamophobic behaviour. The report found evidence of anti-Muslim views at local association and individual level but said claims of ""institutional racism"" were not borne out by the evidence.'No-go areas'Asked about Mr Anderson's comments on BBC Radio London, Paul Scully, a Conservative MP - and former minister for London - said concerns that certain places such as parts of Tower Hamlets in London and Sparkhill in Birmingham had become ""no-go areas"" needed ""to be addressed"".He said: ""Lee tends to shoot from the hip. He sometimes goes too far. This is an occasion when he has gone way, way too far.""Birmingham Labour MP Jess Phillips urged Mr Scully to apologise for his comments about Sparkhill, which she labelled ""utter drivel"". Conservative West Midlands Mayor Andy Street said: ""The idea that Birmingham has a 'no-go' zone is news to me, and I suspect the good people of Sparkhill. It really is time for those in Westminster to stop the nonsense slurs and experience the real world.""The prime minister's official spokesman said Mr Sunak disagreed with Mr Scully's comments, adding: ""The PM has talked before about the value of the very diverse communities and societies that we have in the UK.""Defending his comments in a later interview with BBC London, Mr Scully said he was referring to a ""perception"" but also something that was ""a reality for a handful of people"". ""There are areas where there are a tiny minority of people who make people uncomfortable about not being of their religion, of their culture, who are misinterpreting their own doctrine,"" he said.

Despite repeated defeats in the Lords, the government's large majority means the amendments made by peers are likely to be overturned.The margin of the defeats was narrowed as the Tory administration drafted in rarely seen peers to bolster numbers.It will not become law until both the Commons and Lords agree on the final wording, a process known as parliamentary ping-pong.Peers renewed their demand for the Bill to have ""due regard"" for international and key domestic laws, including human rights and modern slavery legislation, by backing a Labour amendment.

The bill passed its first parliamentary hurdle, despite 29 Tory MPs refusing to back it. However, the government is expected to face trickier battles when the bill returns to the Commons next year.Mr Cleverly said he would listen to ""good faith"" arguments from MPs.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives were ""unified"" in their commitment to deal with the problem posed by migration.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said disagreements over the Rwanda bill were part of an ""ongoing psychodrama"" in the Conservative Party.

The right-wingers on the European Research Group have argued the bill in its current form is not robust enough, with leader of the group Mark Francois saying they had been told Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was ""prepared to entertain tightening the bill"".However, any attempt to change the language could anger other Conservatives who have concerns that could lead to the UK breaching its international obligations. Mr Cleverly said he would listen to his colleagues' concerns and any ""good faith arguments"" about the legislation.Ms Cooper told the BBC that Labour opposed the scheme because it comes with a ""huge cost"" and would only see a small number of people sent to Rwanda. Asked if Labour opposed the principle of the idea of ""offshoring"" - handling claims overseas - she said her party would ""look at whatever works"". Labour along with the Liberal Democrats and SNP voted against the bill on Tuesday night; however, no Conservative MP voted against the bill.There had been fears in government that there could be a Tory rebellion, and in a sign of nerves, Climate Minister Graham Stuart flew back from the COP28 climate conference in Dubai to vote.However, in the end the bill passed with a comfortable 44 majority - with 313 in favour and 270 opposed. Twenty-nine Conservative MPs chose to abstain from voting on the bill - including former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.Altogether 37 Tory MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining. The bill will return to the House of Commons in January, where MPs will be able to propose amendments. Before becoming law, the bill will also have to be approved by the House of Lords where it will meet stiff opposition from some peers.

Starmer defends Thatcher praise in pitch to ToriesHis comments have been met with horror by many on the left of the Labour Party, for whom Mrs Thatcher remains a hate figure.But Tory MPs have reacted with glee. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir grinned awkwardly as Michael Fabricant hailed him as a newly-converted Thatcher ""fan boy"".Mr Sunak said: ""I am always happy to welcome new Thatcherites from all sides of this House. ""But it does say something about the Leader of the Opposition that the main female strong leader he could praise is Margaret Thatcher and not his own fantastic deputy [Angela Rayner].""Ms Rayner looked less than impressed by the exchanges, as she sat at Sir Keir's side, listening to the howls of laughter from the Tory benches.But it was the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn who got one of the biggest laugh of the session when he asked Mr Sunak: ""Is the prime minister worried that he is projected to be the first Conservative Party leader to lose a general election to a fellow Thatcherite?""PA MediaTwo of Sir Keir's role models meet at an event in 2007Asked afterwards if Mr Sunak was worried about Sir Keir's adoption of Thatcher, his spokeswoman took a swipe at the Labour leader's previous support for Jeremy Corbyn, adding: ""I don't think we have too many concerns.

"23 November 2021","Migrant crossings: Number reaching UK this year three times 2020's total","Migrant crossings: Number reaching UK this year three times 2020's total23 November 2021ShareShareGetty ImagesThe number of migrants to have reached the UK by boat this year is now more than three times the 2020 total. The Home Office said 886 people arrived on Saturday, bringing the 2021 total to more than 25,700. The figure for last year was 8,469.More than 1,000 migrants arrived in one day earlier this month, a new record.Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs there was a ""global migration crisis"" and the number of illegal migrants departing France was ""unacceptable"". In answer to an urgent Commons question on the crossings from shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds, she said the government's Nationality and Borders Bill was the ""long-term solution"" to tackling the issue ""on top of a raft of operational and diplomatic work"". A Home Office spokesperson added: ""The British public have had enough of seeing people die in the Channel while ruthless criminal gangs profit from their misery and our new plan for immigration will fix the broken system which encourages migrants to make this lethal journey.""While the number coming across the Channel by boat has soared, that is only part of the picture regarding migrants - as this year has seen far fewer using other strategies to enter the country undetected.It means that, overall, the number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% fall on the previous 12 months. Analysis: It's all about Brexit What happens to migrants who reach the UK? Boats could be turned back in new UK moveThe government's plan would change the law so that people facilitating Channel crossings would face a maximum sentence of life in prison.The proposed changes to immigration, being considered by MPs, would see people seeking protection as refugees having their asylum claim partly assessed on how they arrived in the UK. People arriving by what the government calls illegal means would no longer have the same entitlement to claim asylum. On Saturday, there were 28 separate events, leading to the 886 people either being rescued or intercepted. That same day, French authorities intervened 14 times, preventing 466 people reaching the UK. It is thought at least 10 people have died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing.A switch of strategyWhat we are counting here are the numbers of people who have crossed the Channel in small boats this year and arrived in the UK - the vast majority going on to claim asylum in Britain.However, Home Office figures on overall asylum claims show a 4% fall year-on-year, with fewer people requesting sanctuary in the year to June 2021 than a year earlier.What appears to have happened is that those looking to claim asylum in the UK have switched their strategy. In the past, migrants might have come by aircraft or tried to enter on lorries - but a combination of factors including increased security and Covid have made those traditional routes less viable.  So now the people smugglers and the desperate migrants are using small boats.The Home Office believes its best strategy is to reform the asylum system so that those who come by unauthorised routes are much more likely to be sent back.However, since Brexit, the UK has no return arrangements with any EU country. In the whole of this year, of the 25,000 migrants arriving in small boats, the UK has managed to return just five.A review into how to prevent migrants crossing the English Channel to reach the UK is going to be led by Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay, after the home secretary promised tougher action. Mr Barclay will explore what ministerial departments can do to make the issue more of a priority in government.  The prime minister's spokesman said ""there is more that can be done to step up this enforcement"" from both France and the UK.""We continue to believe that there is more that can be done on both sides,"" he said. ""We are introducing these new powers [in the Nationality and Borders Bill], we will continue to work closely with our French counterparts.He said that joint efforts had stopped more than 20,000 attempts at crossings so far this year.In an agreement signed in July, the UK pledged to give France €62.7m (£54m) during 2021-22 to help tackle the issue.The deal said the UK would help France increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports.Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, Labour MP Yvette Cooper highlighted evidence to the Home Affairs committee that UK-funded drones were not being used by the French authorities to help prevent the crossings.The home secretary said France had in the past week accepted a number of UK proposals around the use of ""surveillance"" as well as other technology including sensors on beaches and automatic number plate recognition.The people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.Under international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say you must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country.What happens to migrants in the English Channel?If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British portIf they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take themEach country has search-and-rescue zonesAn EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace itTHE NEW LABOUR REVOLUTION: Two powerful personalities at the heart of a political phenomenonFROM TOM HANKS TO EMMA THOMPSON: Check out the great films on BBC iPlayerLabour criticises Priti Patel over migrant Channel crossingsHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Minister to lead review into migrant crossingsOnly five Channel migrants returned to EU in 2021Migrant boats could be turned back in new UK moveUK immigrationHome OfficeEnglish ChannelPriti PatelMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59375590"

Ms Abbott is understood to have asked Sir Keir to readmit her to the Parliamentary Labour Party, when he asked her if there was anything he could do.Ms Abbott has sat as an independent since April 2023 when she was suspended from the parliamentary party for a letter she sent a letter to the Observer, in which she wrote that Irish, Jewish and Traveller people were not subject to racism ""all their lives"". She withdrew her remarks and apologised ""for any anguish caused"".In a comment piece for the Guardian on Thursday, she said she was ""upset but not surprised"" by Mr Hester's alleged remarks and accused the Conservative Party of planning to ""play the race card"" at the coming general election.A Tory source, in response, pointed to her April 2023 letter, for which she remains under investigation by Labour. Ms Abbott said it would be ""strange"" if Sir Keir kept her out of the party because of it.She also warned Labour to ""step up to challenge racism"", claiming the party had failed to apologise to her for the content of WhatsApp messages previously sent about her by some Labour officials, found in a report by Martin Forde KC to have, ""consciously or otherwise"", drawn on racist tropes. Labour did not respond to a request for comment.Labour's Paulette Hamilton, Birmingham's first black MP, told BBC News Midlands she feared the comments towards Ms Abbott had added to ""the threat and anxiety levels of MPs in Parliament"".She said  female MPs - and black women in particular - were very close to their constituencies and walk around them a lot.The row over returning Mr Hester's money was sparked by an article in Monday's Guardian.The newspaper reported that in 2019 Mr Hester said: ""It's like trying not to be racist but you see Diane Abbott on the TV, and you're just like I hate, you just want to hate all black women because she's there, and I don't hate all black women at all, but I think she should be shot.""The BBC has not heard a recording, or been able to independently verify the alleged remarks. Mr Hester has been asked whether the reported comments are accurate.In a statement released on Monday, Mr Hester's company said he ""accepts that he was rude about Diane Abbott in a private meeting several years ago but his criticism had nothing to do with her gender nor colour of skin"".The Scottish Conservative Party said it had never accepted a donation from Mr Hester and ""the UK Conservative Party should carefully review the donations it has received from Hester in response to his remarks"".Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said she was writing to every Conservative MP to urge them not accept ""tainted"" money from Mr Hester.Keir StarmerRishi SunakPrime Minister's QuestionsDiane Abbott","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68554476"

Giving a press conference after the legislation was approved by MPs, Mr Sunak said it was now up to the Lords to ""do the right thing"".He told the BBC the government was still aiming for deportation flights to take off by the spring. But he added that peers needed to pass the bill ""as quickly as possible"". The legislation, which seeks to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country, was passed by 320 to 276 votes in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Although in the end only 11 Conservative MPs voted against the legislation as a whole, Mr Sunak still suffered his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister when around 60 backed changes they said would toughen up the legislation. The rebels argue the bill will not work in its current form as they believe flights will still be blocked by legal challenges. The aim of the policy is to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boats, which Mr Sunak has made a key priority of his premiership. However, Labour says it an expensive ""gimmick"", which is unworkable and unlawful. Sunak rebuked by stats watchdog over asylum claimRwanda bill passes but poll gloom still haunts PMWill planes to Rwanda ever take off?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Before becoming law, the bill must be approved by the House of Lords, where it is expected to face strong opposition. The Lords are unlikely to vote it down completely but they can propose changes which would delay its progress. Crossbench peer Lord Carlile, a leading lawyer and former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, described the bill as ""a step towards totalitarianism"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme many peers would see it as ""a step too far"" and an ""illegitimate interference by politics with the law"".Mr Sunak urged peers to pass the bill unamended to get flights up and running, describing this as ""an urgent national priority"". ""The treaty with Rwanda is signed and the legislation which deems Rwanda a safe country has been passed unamended in our elected chamber,"" he said. ""There is now only one question. Will the opposition in the appointed House of Lords try and frustrate the will of the people as expressed by the elected House? Or will they get on board and do the right thing?""Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the PM's comments were ""bizarre"". ""The House of Lords exists to scrutinise legislation,"" he said, adding that this function was ""very important in our democracy"".Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan battle isn’t over yetQuestioned by journalists after the press conference over when flights carrying asylum seekers would leave for Rwanda, the prime minister did not give a concrete date. Asked if he could guarantee flights would take off before the next general election, which is expected this year, Mr Sunak said: ""I've been crystal clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible… and it's now up to the House of Lords.""However, in an interview with the BBC later, he said: ""We're working to the same timetable that we've always been working to... and that means spring but obviously the House of Lords needs to pass its legislation as quickly as possible.""Peers are due to begin debating the Rwanda bill before the end of this month, with the most crucial votes held in early March, according to senior House of Lords sources. After this, the legislation will enter ""ping pong"", where the Commons and Lords try to reconcile their versions of the bill. This is likely to involve the government trying to remove any changes inserted by the Lords. If all goes to plan the bill should pass around mid-March. Even after it becomes law, Mr Sunak's critics believe legal challenges could still delay or block deportation flights.Debate over the bill has exposed the deep divisions within the Conservative Party. On Tuesday two deputy party chairmen - Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith - as well as a ministerial aide, Jane Stevenson, quit their roles to rebel against the government and vote for changes to the bill. The BBC has been told a handful of Tory MPs have submitted letters calling for a vote of confidence in Mr Sunak. However, this is almost impossible to prove unless an MP chooses to publish their letter. It would take 15% of the parliamentary party - currently 53 MPs - to submit letters to trigger a no-confidence vote. After this a majority of Tory MPs would have to vote against Mr Sunak in a secret ballot for him to be removed as leader.

The former immigration minister is leading Tory efforts to rewrite the legislation in the House of Commons.Rishi Sunak says it is already the toughest immigration law ever proposed.But Tory rebels say it will not work in its current form and fulfil the prime minister's much-delayed pledge to start sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda.""The test of whether it works is not can we get a few symbolic flights off in the months ahead, with a small number of illegal migrants on them,"" Mr Jenrick told the Commons. Instead, he said it needed to create ""a sustainable deterrent"" to stop people crossing the Channel in small boats. Follow live: MPs debate Rwanda billTory deputy chairs back move to 'beef up' Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Analysis: Tory divisions on show as Rwanda votes loomAmendments tabled by Mr Jenrick - who resigned as immigration minister last year over the legislation - and veteran Conservative Sir Bill Cash are among those which are being considered by MPs. They aim to restrict an individual's ability to block their removal to Rwanda and prevent international law being considered in legal challenges against the policy. Mr Jenrick told MPs the proposals ""seek to address the evident flaws of the bill"" and ""represent the last opportunity for us to get this policy right"". He argued the current bill left open loopholes which would allow individuals to challenge their deportation on the basis that Rwanda would not be safe for them specifically, even if it was deemed a safe country overall. More than 60 Tory MPs are backing the amendments including two deputy Conservative chairmen - Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith. However, they are not expected to pass as both the government and opposition parties are likely to vote them down.The bigger test for the government will be a vote expected on Wednesday, when the rebels could vote against the entire bill. If around 30 Tory MPs joined opposition parties in voting against the legislation it could be defeated. Earlier, Mr Jenrick told Sky News he was prepared to vote against the bill if it was not improved. At least three other Tory MPs - including former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - have publicly said the same, with reports that more could join them.The government's Rwanda policy was blocked by the Supreme Court on the grounds of concerns about the safety of the east African country for asylum seekers. Following the court decision, the government introduced the Safety of Rwanda Bill which states that in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country.Labour's shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock described the Rwanda policy as ""unaffordable, unworkable and unlawful"". He urged MPs to back Labour's amendments to the legislation ""in the interests of damage limitation"". These include ensuring that courts can consider the risk of refoulement - where asylum seekers are returned to a country where they face persecution - when making decisions on removals to Rwanda. Court capacityAhead of the debate in the Commons, the government announced plans to expand court capacity and train 150 judges to run a new fast-track appeals system for Rwanda deportations. The extra resources are designed to deal with criticism from some Conservative MPs that individual appeals against deportation to Rwanda will clog up the courts and should be disallowed entirely.Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the changes will free up 5,000 additional sitting days to hear asylum cases.Judges will receive additional training and will be paid more to sit on evenings and weekends. The government has also created 25 additional hearing rooms to deal with cases.However, a Tory rebel source said the government ""seem to be conceding the courts will be overwhelmed with migrants' individual claims"".

He told a conference fringe meeting that, although it did not represent Labour policy, the paper was a ""handy checklist"" for the sort of changes the party could pursue in office.He said Labour would seek an agreement on security co-operation with the EU, and greater mutual recognition of qualifications to boost the trade in professional services.It remains unclear whether Brussels would entertain major changes to the UK's trade deal. Senior EU figures have signalled they do not see rewriting the 2020 agreement as a goal of the review.'Check the oil'Mr Benn said new Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland negotiated by Mr Sunak in late February were a ""considerable step forward"" in UK-EU relations.He acknowledged that the deal, known as the Windsor Framework, was not going to be reopened.But he told party activists the deal ""shows what can be done"" within the existing structure of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.He acknowledged some in Europe had spoken about the review as a chance to ""check the oil level and see if it's all working"".""And yet the Windsor Framework was definitely not a minor tweak,"" he added.Speaking at the same event, the EU ambassador to the UK said the relationship between the two sides was ""starting to enter a much better path"".Pedro Serrano added that the EU was prepared to ""continue building"" on the 2020 trade deal, but stressed it was already one of the ""most ambitious"" it had concluded with a non-member country.Labour MP Stella Creasy, who chairs a party group that pushes for stronger ties with Europe, told the event that reversing Brexit would be ""impossible"".But, she added, she hoped the 2026 review would see a ""powerful intervention"" to boost ties.She said she wanted to see the party pursue ""as much direct access to the single market as possible,"" adding that it should be ""ruthlessly focused"" on reducing costs for consumers and easing red tape for businesses.Labour tries to clarify Starmer Brexit commentsStarmer seeks new EU deal to stop small boats gangsHilary BennLabour PartyEuropean Union","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67058842"
"7 December 2023","New Rwanda bill gives ministers power to disregard some human rights law","New Rwanda bill gives ministers power to disregard some human rights law7 December 2023ShareBecky Morton & Dominic CascianiBBC NewsSharePA MediaA draft law, which aims to enable the government's flagship Rwanda policy to go ahead, gives ministers the power to disregard some human rights law.The government said the bill, which will be introduced in Parliament on Thursday, made clear in UK law Rwanda was a safe country for asylum seekers. But it does not go as far as some Conservative MPs on the right of the party had called for. The legislation aims to address the concerns of the Supreme Court. Last month, the UK's highest court ruled that the plans to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were unlawful.The policy, which was first announced by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022, aims to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats.But it has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and no asylum seekers have been sent to Rwanda from the UK so far.  Tory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?The bill, which must be voted on by Parliament, orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act in an attempt to sidestep the Supreme Court's existing judgment. It also orders the courts to ignore other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - that stand in the way of deportations to Rwanda.However, it does not go as far as some Tory MPs wanted.  Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and her supporters had called for it to override the entire Human Rights Act, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Refugee Convention, and all other international law.'Fatally flawed' The bill allows ministers to ignore any emergency order from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to temporarily halt a flight to Rwanda while an individual case is still being considered.But it stops short of disapplying the whole of the ECHR. It also allows migrants to legally challenge their removal to Rwanda on specific individual grounds, if they can prove that being put on a plane would leave them at real risk of serious harm.A source close to Mrs Braverman said the bill was ""fatally flawed"" and would be ""bogged down in the courts for months and months"". ""The prime minister has kept the ability for every single illegal migrant to make individual human rights claims against their removal and to then appeal those claims if they don't succeed at first,"" the source said.""It is a further betrayal of Tory voters and the decent patriotic majority who want to see this insanity brought to an end.""The government said the bill would ""end the merry-go-round of legal challenges"" preventing asylum seekers being removed to Rwanda. However, the draft legislation concedes that it may not be compatible with minimum human rights safeguards.Legislation rarely goes before MPs with such a legal warning. It means lawyers have told ministers the measures could still be legally challenged - and the Supreme Court could find them incompatible with human rights obligations and therefore unworkable.Rwanda's foreign affairs minister Vincent Biruta said the country would not be able to continue with the scheme ""without lawful behaviour by the UK"". He said: ""It has always been important to both Rwanda and the UK that our rule of law partnership meets the highest standards of international law, and it places obligations on both the UK and Rwanda to act lawfully.""Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said: ""Through this new landmark emergency legislation, we will control our borders, deter people taking perilous journeys across the Channel and end the continuous legal challenges filling our courts.""Home Secretary James Cleverly signed a new treaty with Rwanda on Tuesday. The government hopes the treaty, combined with the new bill, will be enough to allow the Rwanda scheme to go ahead.Labour has pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the next election.Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the government and the Conservative Party were in ""total chaos"".""They've got open warfare among their backbenches, the starting gun fired on the next leadership election and once again the whole country paying the price for this chaos,"" she told the Commons.Braverman: Tories face oblivion if Rwanda bill failsTory splits emerge ahead of Rwanda migration lawWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?UK immigrationImmigrationRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67641805"
"1 March 2024","UK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum deal, watchdog says","UK to pay at least £370m to Rwanda for asylum deal, watchdog says1 March 2024ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterSharePA MediaThe Rwanda policy aims to deter people from crossing the Channel in small boatsThe UK will pay at least £370m to Rwanda as part of its plan to relocate asylum seekers there, the government's spending watchdog has revealed. Up to £150,000 will also be paid for each person sent to the east African country over a five-year period.Labour said the new figures in the report by the National Audit Office (NAO) were a ""national scandal"". However, the Home Office said: ""Doing nothing is not without significant costs.""A spokesperson said: ""Unless we act, the cost of housing asylum seekers is set to reach £11bn per year by 2026.""Illegal migration costs lives and perpetuates human trafficking, and it is therefore right that we fund solutions to break this unsustainable cycle.""The NAO report comes after MPs have been calling for greater transparency over the cost of the scheme.  Under the five-year deal, the UK would be able to send individuals who arrive in the country illegally to Rwanda to claim asylum there. The aim of the policy is to deter people from crossing the English Channel in small boats - something Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made one of his key priorities. However, the scheme has been stalled by legal challenges and no one has been relocated there yet. The government says it is aiming for deportation flights to take off by the spring. Legislation seeking to revive the plan has been approved by MPs and will be debated in the House of Lords next week, where critics are likely to seize on the latest costs. £63,000 more to remove a migrant than keep in UKWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Under the scheme, the Home Office has agreed to pay money into a fund to support economic growth in Rwanda, as well as providing extra payments to cover the cost of processing and relocating individuals there. The UK has already paid £220m into the economic development fund since April 2022, with further annual payments of £50m scheduled for the next three years. This amounts to a total of £370m over five years. If more than 300 people are eventually sent to Rwanda, the UK would pay a one-off sum of £120m into the fund, with further payments of £20,000 per individual relocated. On top of this, the UK government would also provide up to £150,874 per person to cover costs such as accommodation, food and education. These payments would stop if the individual chooses to leave Rwanda, with the UK instead paying £10,000 per person to facilitate their departure.  The NAO's report also reveals that the cost of setting up the scheme could rise from £20m to £28m. There are also expected to be other future costs, including an estimated £11,000 per individual for flights to Rwanda. The NAO does not come to a judgement on whether the scheme is value for money as the watchdog said this would depend on whether it is successful in deterring people from coming to the UK illegally.Labour has pledged to scrap the Rwanda policy if it wins the next election, describing it as an expensive ""gimmick"". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""This report reveals the national scandal the Tories have been trying to hide. ""Its shocking analysis shows the costs of the failed Rwanda farce are even higher than previously thought.""The report was produced in response to a request from two cross-party committees of MPs - the Public Accounts and Home Affairs Committees. In December the Home Office's most senior civil servant wrote to the chairwomen of both committees to reveal some of the costs associated with the scheme but they said this did not provide enough information on how much had been spent so far.

"13 January 2024","Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill","Tory MPs pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak over Rwanda bill13 January 2024ShareChas GeigerPolitical reporterSharePARishi Sunak is facing mounting pressure from Tory MPs over his Rwanda bill.Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has warned she will vote against it unless he accepts ""improvements"" to strengthen the legislation.  More than 50 MPs on the right of the party, including Liz Truss, are now backing moves to toughen up the bill.  The prime minister is trying to revive his plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda after the Supreme Court ruled the earlier scheme was unlawful.  Meanwhile, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, from the centrist One Nation group of MPs, has backed three amendments which would tone down some parts of the bill. Mrs Braverman, who was sacked as home secretary by Mr Sunak in November, told GB News the current version of the bill ""does not work"" and would amount to ""a betrayal to the British public"".The legislation will return to the Commons next Tuesday and Wednesday, when MPs will debate and vote on a series of amendments. It will then face a final Commons vote which it must clear to be sent to the Lords for further scrutiny.   Asked how she would vote at this stage if there were no changes, Mrs Braverman replied: ""If there are no improvements to it, I will have to vote against it, I'm afraid. I am sent to Parliament to vote for things, to be for things or to be against them, not to sit on the fence. Sunak facing major Tory revolt over Rwanda billSunak had doubts over Rwanda plan, papers suggestCan the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?""I owe it to the British people to be transparent and honest about the situation that we are in. It is absolutely essential that we deliver on this pledge to stop the boats.""   Writing on X, formerly Twitter, on Thursday, former prime minister Ms Truss said: ""We need to crack down on illegal migration and remove the loopholes being exploited by activist lawyers. ""It's essential the legislation we are passing is watertight. That's why I am backing amendments to the Bill.""Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned last month over the legislation and is co-ordinating a series of rebel amendments, has warned the bill as it stands is ""guaranteed to fail"".  Illegal migrants would continue to successfully challenge their removal in court, in a fresh ""merry-go-round"" of appeals, he said.The government insists the legislation, the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, will allow only a ""vanishingly small"" number of appeals. But the amendments backed by Sir Robert would delete clauses from the bill declaring Rwanda ""a safe country"", disapplying the Human Rights Act, and forcing courts to disregard interim rulings by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The One Nation group is the largest single faction within the Conservative parliamentary party. It says more than 100 MPs are members, almost a third of the total.PA MediaA group of people thought to be migrants are brought into Dungeness, KentIt argues that the UK's human rights obligations in international law must be respected. Former first secretary of state Damian Green, who chairs the group, said he had been assured the bill would not be strengthened. ""The prime minister's looked me in the eye and said that he doesn't want to go any further,"" he told the New Statesman. The Rwandan government has said it will pull out of the scheme if it does not comply with international obligations.Downing Street said the government would carry on talking to MPs and ""carefully consider"" amendments put forward. It had worked to ensure the bill was ""robust"", No 10 added. Before Christmas, Mr Sunak comfortably saw off a Tory rebellion over the bill, when it cleared its first Commons hurdle by a majority of 44 votes. But the scale of party divisions on the issue has again been highlighted in recent days - with a number of former cabinet ministers, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, backing the amendments from MPs on the right of the party.  Nearly two years after Boris Johnson's government first announced plans to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda, none has been sent to the east African country. 'Gimmick'The bill aims to stop flights being grounded by legal action by declaring that, in UK law, Rwanda is a safe country. It would enable ministers to ignore emergency orders from the ECHR to suspend a flight there while an individual legal case was being heard.But rebels insist it would still allow the policy to be derailed by a wave of individual appeals, and want to tighten the circumstances in which they would be allowed.They also want to make it the default position that ministers would ignore ECHR injunctions, blocking flights.The prime minister has promised to stop migrants crossing the Channel in small boats and argues his Rwanda scheme will prove a significant deterrent. Labour says the scheme is a hugely expensive ""gimmick"" which will not work, and Sir Keir Starmer has accused Mr Sunak of being ""taken hostage by his own party"". It says it would tackle illegal migration by prioritising the smashing of people-smuggling gangs.  'Safe routes'  The government has a working Commons majority over other parties and independent MPs of 56, implying that 29 Conservative MPs would need to vote against the bill to defeat it. But in practice that majority is larger because some independent MPs usually vote with the government and others tend to be absent. In addition to this, some Tory rebels are likely to abstain, while others may also vote with the government. If the bill does clear its Commons stages, it is likely to face prolonged opposition in the Lords. Meanwhile, the Home Office has published a report on ""safe and legal routes"" for migrants seeking to enter the UK, but it does not list any new routes.  Campaigners have long argued that the government needs to provide safe routes for people seeking refuge from war and oppression, to help tackle illegal migration. During debates on the Illegal Migration Act, which became law in July 2023 and bars anyone entering the UK illegally from claiming asylum, ministers promised to ""specify additional safe and legal routes"".No 10 said there were already a significant number of routes and its priority was to secure the UK's borders. ""While the compassion of the UK is clearly unlimited, our capacity is not,"" the prime minister's spokesman added.In a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary James Cleverly said the report reaffirmed the government's ""commitment to providing safe and legal routes for those most in need"". ""As we get control on numbers, we will keep under review whether we are able to do more to support vulnerable refugees and whether we need to consider new safe and legal routes,"" he added.Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon described the report as ""woefully inadequate with no meaningful commitment to expand safe routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Syria, and those fleeing repressive regimes in countries such as Iran"".""By simply focusing on describing the existing limited schemes, the government has completely overlooked the urgent need to reduce dangerous Channel crossings by providing safe passage to our shores,"" he said.

No I didn't.""A Labour spokesperson, responding to the incident, said the party takes all complaints extremely seriously, adding: ""These are fully investigated in line with party rules and procedures"".Labour's code of conduct was drawn up earlier this month and followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks.The code does reproduce the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic. But Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs have been critical, pointing out the code does not include four working examples provided by the IHRA definition. They say the party should adopt these examples in complete form from the IHRA.Labour says its own wording ""expands on and contextualises"" the IHRA examples.The party has said that while the examples are not reproduced word for word, they are covered elsewhere in the new code and it has produced ""robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"".The IHRA examples of anti-Semitic behaviour include requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations and comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis.How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfoldedAccording to the Observer, Mr Austin received a letter warning him he could face disciplinary action following the incident. Speaking to the Radio 4 programme The World This Weekend, Mr Austin denied he was using the ongoing anti-Semitism debate as a way to attack Jeremy Corbyn.Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said anti-Semitism is wrong and it will not be tolerated in the party. Anti-Semitism is simply wrong - CorbynMr Austin said the Labour leader had always been on the ""extreme fringes"" of the party, ""supporting and defending all sorts of extremists and in some cases frankly, anti-Semites"".""That's why I think now that somebody with views and history like his isn't really suited to the leadership of a mainstream political party,"" he said.""Am I upset about anti-Semitism? Yes I am. And I'm upset as well about the leadership's failure, I think refusal really, to deal with this properly.""I grew up listening to my dad tell me how he'd escaped from the Holocaust and how his mum and sisters were murdered in Treblinka [a Nazi death camp] and that led to me joining Labour Party as a teenager determined to fight racism.""""I'm really shocked that a party that has got a proud tradition throughout its entire existence of fighting racism has ended up causing such huge offence and distress to the Jewish community in Britain.""Mr Austin said he was ""ashamed of the Labour Party"", adding: ""We are becoming a different political party. This could just never have happened in the past.""Mr Austin is the second Labour MP to face suspension, after the party launched a disciplinary inquiry into Labour veteran Margaret Hodge.She reportedly swore at Jeremy Corbyn and called him an anti-Semite.Margaret Hodge says she is ""incredibly upset"" at Labour's anti-Semitism rowLabour's shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said he would not condemn Mr Austin as he ""didn't see what happened"", adding that he hoped the situation could be resolved ""amicably"".""What we need to ensure is that the people who disciplinary action is taken against are the small number in the party who have said or done anti-Semitic things, not those who have strong opinions about things we should all have strong opinions about.""Labour's National Executive Committee approved its new code following continuing criticism of its handling of anti-Jewish discrimination and attitudes within its ranks.After criticism of its code of conduct, the party said it would ""in recognition of the serious concerns expressed... reopen the development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. The party's MPs will vote in September on whether to adopt the full IHRA wording after passing an emergency motion at a meeting on Monday night.Jewish newspapers unite against LabourMPs criticise Labour's anti-Semitism codeEarlier this week, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers united to publish the same front page, warning that a Corbyn-led government would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"".Two senior members of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet have also suggested the controversial new code of conduct should be rewritten.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth urged the party's ruling NEC to ""reconsider"" its decision and include the full definition.Barry Gardiner, shadow international trade secretary, said it ""would have been better"" to adopt the IHRA definition in full. Labour MPs Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Anna Turley have also been critical.And five senior Scottish Labour politicians - MSPs Monica Lennon, Jackie Baillie, Anas Sarwar, Daniel Johnson and Colin Smyth - on Sunday said they want the wider party to adopt the wording in full.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Labour has become a party that ""obstructs measures to counter hatred and punishes those who speak out against it"" and called on Mr Corbyn to lead it out of ""this deep abyss"".How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfoldedLabour takes action against MP HodgeJewish newspapers unite against Labour","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44997634"

Not a lot28 January 2024ShareLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergShare1:21Watch: Voters from areas that flipped from Labour to Conservative share their thoughts on Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer'We're not allowed to swear, are we?"" Both Conservative and Labour politicians might have muttered a curse or two if they had been in the room on Wednesday in Manchester, when we invited nearly 50 voters to share what was on their minds. We did encourage them not to swear, as we will be showing their conversations on BBC One on Sunday. But the sentiments were strong. Our groups were upset and frustrated about the state of the country, which was ""in crisis"", ""depressing"" and ""dishonest and messed up"". And they did not spare the feelings of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak or Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. ""Incompetent cretin"", ""dull"" and "" ""not strong enough"" was how some put it. Read on to find who was the target of which hurled insults.For months, the polls have shown Labour convincingly ahead - with some surveys pointing to a massive majority.  In Westminster, fewer and fewer Conservatives seem to believe they have a chance to turn things around. There was even a botched attempt to dethrone Mr Sunak as prime minister this week. But that is Westminster - we wanted to hear what is actually going on in the public's minds. Nearly 50 voters spoke to us about their views on the state of the UKSo, with the help of the research group More In Common, we invited nearly 50 members of the public to come and share their views. They all came from former Labour seats in the north west of England that were turned blue by Boris Johnson's Conservatives in 2019. They were carefully selected to give a range of views from different political tribes: Loyal ConservativesLoyal Labour votersPeople who voted Conservative last time but have decided to switch their votes to LabourThose voting for the first time this year, and voters interested in the smaller parties, such as the Liberal Democrats or GreensThose thinking about voting for Reform UK (the party Nigel Farage is president of)And a last group, crucial for Rishi Sunak - voters who backed the Tories in 2019 but are undecided now Our conversations, of course, do not give us a scientific report on the exact state of public opinion. But we saw a snapshot of Britain in a Room, hearing from diverse voters - young, old, well-off, and struggling.You can read how the participants were chosen here.If you are of a nervous disposition, maybe look away now. We discovered a deep pessimism about the state of the country - just one person saw optimism for 2024.The top reason for the gloom? The huge increases in the cost of living.Inflation may have eased off, but everyone we heard from has been feeling the pinch. James, a student, was one of many struggling with the cost of livingJames, a student, told us that some weeks he can hardly afford to eat. Jean, an NHS worker, has been working nights and taking on extra shifts. Pensioner Barry's fixed income is being stretched and stretched. Nearly everyone had a horror story about the NHS too. Carer Amy told us of ""ridiculous"" ambulance waits when those she looks after need help. Michael, a dad of six with a heart condition, has been waiting more than six months for treatment.On this week's show are Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds, along with Carlos Del Toro, US Secretary of the NavyWatch live on BBC One and iPlayer from 09:00 GMT on SundayFollow latest updates in text and video on the BBC News website from 08:00Jean claims there are not even enough basic supplies like paper towels or toilet paper at the mental health unit she works on.Creating optimism or political excitement in this kind of atmosphere will be a tall order. It is important to say there are some better signs from the economy - which was tentatively growing when the last set of figures were released.Optimistic Tories are hoping this becomes a trend. But that sentiment had not reached our assembled voters this week. What, then, did they make of those vying for their votes? Even among loyal Tory voters, hardly anyone in our group believed that Mr Sunak was doing a good job - or even has the right set of skills to sort out the country's problems.Our panels repeatedly mentioned the prime minister's family wealth, branding him out of touch and unable to get anything done.First time voter James, who is planning to vote Green, labels him an ""incompetent cretin"".""It's like he's reading from a script when he talks,"" Lib Dem-supporting Rebecca said.While Reform UK voter Tracy thinks Mr Sunak has ""no personality"".Voters have also taken notice of the Conservative in-fighting.Sheila said there was ""fighting and bickering"" within the Conservative party""No wonder he can't get anything done, because there's fighting and bickering,"" Tory voter Sheila said.""I've never known a party like it, ever,"" she added.If there is any good news for Mr Sunak, it's that several voters admired his work as chancellor. Conservative-voting Michael said he'd done a ""marvellous job"" before becoming the prime minister.There was a consensus among every group that the prime minister's task is almost impossible.  And Mr Sunak might not be the right person to do it.You can watch more of what they said here, and hear more about why they reached those conclusions on Sunday at 09.00 GMT on the show. But what about the leader who polls predict will be the next resident of No 10?According to our groups, Labour's lead is not out of love for Sir Keir, or even party policy.Undecided young student teacher Jonny said: ""I don't know what he actually believes, I think everything he says is to try and win the majority over.""Ian, who plans to vote Labour, told us he would prefer ""somebody that was either here or there, not somewhere in between"".Debra, a business owner who is undecided about how to vote, said: 'I don't look at him and think, he's the one that's going to come and save us.""Voters also still fear a comeback from Jeremy Corbyn's team, despite four years out of power. ""Who'd be in his Cabinet, that's my fear,"" said Steven, a barrister who's intending to vote for Reform UK.Undecided voter Jonny found Sir Keir Starmer insincereThere was some good news for Sir Keir. Karen, a switcher from Conservative to Labour, said she liked him - ""I think he has got integrity"".But the sense from our sample was that Sir Keir is ahead by default. ""The lesser of two evils,"" was a phrase used by several of our panellists.The mood in the room did not indicate that Labour is in any way heading for an enthusiastic victory - more a grudging win.Our groups were chosen carefully, but this is not a science. All the answers should be taken with a heavy pinch of salt.We have seen a meaningful snapshot of how the public are thinking. We are still many months from the election and voters are volatile.Our discussions make make grim viewing for party leaders.But in more than 20 years of covering politics I have never sensed such a lack of belief in all our politicians' ability to solve the country's problems.The public has always enjoyed being rude about politicians. They've always been rightly sceptical.There was no ""good old days"" when the public completely trusted political geniuses.There was: anger around the Iraq War; despair during the credit crunch; disbelief over the expenses scandal; division during the Brexit years; public pain during the pandemic; fury over Partygate and horror at the market meltdown under Liz Truss.Politics has theoretically returned to a kind of normal after all that - with two fairly conventional party leaders.What seems new is a sense our politics and politicians are dwarfed by the size of the country's problems, according to our Britain in a Room study.Before persuading voters to back them, politicians may have to prove to the country they can make a difference at all.Tune in on Sunday to hear more of what Britain in a Room think Photos: Emma Lynch/BBCWhat questions would you like to ask Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds this Sunday?In some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Has Sunak seen off latest Tory wobbles?What we know about the Sunak family’s wealthConservative PartyKeir StarmerRishi SunakLabour Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68117596"
"14 August 2023","Ministers face renewed pressure over boat crossings","Ministers face renewed pressure over boat crossings14 August 2023ShareAndre Rhoden-Paul, Bethany Bell & Lisa Louisin London and CalaisShareReutersMinisters are facing renewed pressure to tackle boat crossings in the Channel after six migrants died when a vessel sank off the French coast on Saturday.Labour said people smugglers were ""running rings"" around the government, and a Tory backbencher said the UK had a ""moral duty, both to our own citizens and... asylum seekers, to act"".The government has made ""stopping the boats"" one of its five priorities.Investigations continue into the incident which saw 59 people rescued.The overloaded vessel, which got into difficulty and capsized 12 miles (20km) off Sangatte, was said to be one of a number of migrant vessels which set off in the hope of reaching the UK.The incident happened in French waters at about 04:00 local time, with British and French teams working together to rescue the migrants.  The people on board were reported to be mainly Afghan with some Sudanese.More than 100,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the Channel in small boats in the last five years. and more than 500 arrived on Saturday.A new law, the Illegal Migration Act, is central to the government's plans to stop small boats crossing the Channel. It aims to deter people from making such journeys by detaining and removing those who do.But plans to do this by sending some of them to Rwanda, to claim asylum there, is still subject to legal challenge. Shadow cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson told BBC Breakfast: ""The events in the Channel are absolutely tragic.... and demonstrate why we need much tougher action to crack down on criminal gangs that are exploiting people, putting them in harms' way"".She said saying convictions had fallen for people smugglers under the current government and accused ministers of presiding over a Home Office which was ""increasingly shambolic and completely incompetent"".Ms Phillipson added a ""better, fairer system"" was needed to address a backlog of asylum applications ""that is completely out of control"". How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Channel migrant crossings pass 100,000 since 2018How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Calls for action have also come from within the Conservative Party. Backbench MP and ex-party chairman Sir Jake Berry said ""only radical changes can truly turn the tide"".Writing in the Sunday Express, he called for the UK to leave the European Convention of Human Rights, which he claimed would continue to block ""any and all attempts to stop the boats"".Refugee charity Care4Calais said the incident was an ""appalling and preventable tragedy"", while the Refugee Council warned ""more people will die"" unless more safe routes to the UK are created.Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who chaired a meeting with UK Border Force officials on Saturday, said the deaths were a ""tragic loss of life"".Conservative minister David TC Davies says the government has already stopped ""a lot"" of boats and insisted the controversial Rwanda policy was a solution. He said it would ""take away the incentive to jump into rickety boats"".A government spokesman said Labour was ""cynically using the deaths"" to make ""cheap political points"".Labour was not offering any solutions, they said, while the government was ""determined to break the people smuggling gangs' business model and save people's lives"".The government has also struck an agreement with France, under which the UK will pay £500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. A Home Office spokesperson said the Nationality and Borders Act, which came into effect in April 2022, was ""beginning to have an impact on the exploitative business model of people smugglers"", with more than 650 people arrested.French authorities have in the past pointed to the English Channel's long coast line as making it extremely difficult for the coastguard to prevent all small boat crossings.On Saturday, 509 people made the journey across the Channel to the UK, government figures show, bringing this year's total to 16,679. The English Channel is one of the most dangerous and busiest shipping lanes in the world, with 600 tankers and 200 ferries passing through it every day. French authorities said the migrant boat was first detected by a commercial vessel, before a French patrol boat was dispatched to the boat in distress.French sea minister Hervé Berville said: ""While we mourn these victims... it is the responsibility of human traffickers - of criminals - who send young people, women, adults, to their death on these maritime routes that are dangerous and lethal.""Investigators are looking for any information that might lead them to the smuggling gang which organised the crossing.Aid workers in Calais say more migrants have been arriving in recent weeks and have been living rough on the coastline. They say many of them are determined to get to the UK, despite warnings over the dangers of the crossing. The pressure on the ministers follows criticism after 39 asylum seekers had to be moved off the Bibby Stockholm barge moored off the Dorset coast because of the discovery of Legionella bacteria in the water supply.Six dead after migrant boat sinks in ChannelChannel migrant crossings pass 100,000 since 2018UK immigrationFranceHome OfficeEnglish ChannelImmigrationEurope migrant crisisCalais","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66490218"
"18 January 2024","Rwandan president Paul Kagame suggests UK could get money back","Rwandan president Paul Kagame suggests UK could get money back18 January 2024ShareShareWatch: In an exclusive BBC video, President Kagame offered to return UK taxpayer's money if no refugees enter RwandaRwanda's President Paul Kagame has said he could return money to the UK if no asylum seekers are sent to his country under his deal with the government. The UK has paid £240m to Rwanda, with a further £50m to come. So far, no asylum seekers have been sent to the country.Asked on why he was taking the money, Mr Kagame said: ""It's only going to be used if those people will come. If they don't come, we can return the money.""But Rwanda's government later specified there was ""no obligation"" to do so.In a statement after Mr Kagame's comments on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said that if the UK requests a refund ""we will consider this"".The president's remarks came before a key vote in the Commons, which saw MPs pass legislation to revive the deportation scheme, after it was ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court last year.The draft law will now head for further scrutiny in the House of Lords, where it is expected to run into considerable opposition.Sunak sees off Tory rebels as MPs back Rwanda billWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In its statement, the Rwandan government said funds paid to Rwanda were intended to support the country's economic development as well as to ""prepare to receive and care for the migrants when they arrive"".""Under the terms of the agreement, Rwanda has no obligation to return any of the funds paid,"" spokeswoman Yolande Makolo added.""However, if no migrants come to Rwanda under the scheme, and the UK government wishes to request a refund of the portion of the funding allocated to support the migrants, we will consider this request.""To talk about figures at this point is premature, as we are still awaiting the conclusion of the UK legislative process and remain committed to making the partnership work."" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claims his plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to travel across the Channel in small boats.But Labour says it is an expensive ""gimmick"" that won't work - and that they would scrap the policy if they win the general election.'UK's problem'A vote on Wednesday evening saw MPs pass legislation to resurrect the scheme, after a Conservative rebellion failed to materialise.But dozens of Tory backbenchers made a failed attempt to amend the bill, arguing the legislation will not do enough to stop individual appeals derailing deportation flights. Ahead of the vote, the BBC's Economics Editor Faisal Islam grabbed a brief interview with Paul Kagame on the margins of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The president did not clarify how much of the money he could return to the UK, or when. Asked about the current political and legal obstacles around the deal with his country, Mr Kagame said that it is ""not Rwanda's problem"". ""Ask the UK, it is the UK's problem, not Rwanda's problem"", he added.How first £120m of UK Rwanda funding was spentEducation: 39%Health: 13%Job creation: 19%Infrastructure: 21%Agriculture: 5%IT-related: 3%Source: The Home OfficeLabour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed Mr Kagame's offer to refund the money, and pledged to put it towards ""processing asylum cases"" and ""cracking down on the criminal gangs that are at the heart of this.""Speaking in Davos, she said: ""That would be a much better use of the money and would have a much greater chance of success in controlling the small boat crossings that we absolutely need to do.""'Lost' asylum seekersLabour says the Rwanda scheme will eventually cost UK taxpayers £400m.Watch: Sir Keir Starmer asks the PM about ""lost contact"" with people due to be sent to RwandaAt Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed the government had ""lost contact"" more than 4,000 people it had lined up for removal to Rwanda.It follows a Daily Telegraph story - citing Home Office documents - saying that only 700 of the original 5,000 people earmarked for deportation are in ""regular contact"" with officials.""Spending £400m on a plan not to get anybody to Rwanda whilst losing 4,000 people is not a plan, it's a farce,"" said Sir Keir. ""Only this government can waste hundreds of millions of pounds on a removals policy that doesn't remove anyone.""Mr Sunak defended the government's record on immigration, before adding: ""It's a bit rich to hear him in here pretending that he cares about how we actually stop the boats, when he's been crystal clear and said that even if the plan is working to reduce the numbers, he would still scrap it.""It's because he has no values, no conviction and no plan, and it's back to square one.""The Home Office told BBC Verify the department's documents were leaked to The Telegraph and are not publicly available.It said the figures published are based on ""out of date operational data"" from last year. It did not say when or whether there are more up to date figures available.The Home Office said that it has a ""dedicated team who work with police and other partners, to help trace and locate absconders using all available technologies"".Keir StarmerRishi SunakPrime Minister's QuestionsRwandaPaul Kagame","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68007463"
"27 November 2018","Brexit: Theresa May defends deal amid criticism from MPs","Brexit: Theresa May defends deal amid criticism from MPs27 November 2018ShareShare8:12Theresa May on Northern Ireland backstop: ""This is an insurance policy no-one wants to use.""Theresa May has defended her proposed Brexit deal in the Commons in the face of sustained criticism from the opposition and many Conservative MPs. She said the deal delivered on the result of the EU referendum - and MPs will get to vote on it on 11 December. But she admitted she was not ""entirely happy"" with the ""backstop"" contingency plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn said ""ploughing on"" with a deal opposed by the public and MPs was an ""act of national self-harm"".The Labour leader suggested Parliament would have ""little choice"" but to reject the deal when MPs vote on it.A host of former Tory cabinet ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Owen Paterson, Michael Fallon and Dominic Grieve, also said the deal was unsatisfactory, during the two-and-half hour debate. Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal?May regrets EU 'queue-jumpers' commentWinning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM?A simple guide to where we are with BrexitLib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable joined a number of Labour MPs and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas in calling for the prime minister to back another EU referendum ""with the option of remaining in the European Union"".Mrs May rejected all of these calls and told Sir Vince it was time to ""deliver on the choice the British people made"" in the 2016 referendum.Mrs May faces an uphill struggle to persuade MPs to accept the terms of the withdrawal agreement - and a political declaration on future relations between the EU and UK - approved by EU leaders on Sunday.What was May's pitch to MPs?Mrs May said there had been ""give and take"" in the 19-month negotiations but the final agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders.2:59Theresa May: ""We are proud Gibraltar is British and our position on sovereignty has not, and will not, change.""She acknowledged concerns over arrangements to avoid the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could see the UK entering a customs arrangement with the EU - known as the ""backstop"".Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wranglingReality Check: Theresa May's Brexit letterWhat happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?Parties keen to join a Brexit TV debateThe ""backstop"" was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use,"" Mrs May told MPs, and she insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force if the UK's future relationship was not settled by the end of 2020, as she hoped it would.A backstop of some kind would be required, she said, due to the UK's obligation to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace deal signed 20 years ago, adding ""there is no deal that comes without a backstop and without a backstop there is no deal"".She also insisted she had stood firm in the face of repeated EU attempts to link access to British waters for their fishermen to future trade arrangements, amid claims from the SNP and others that her deal had ""sold out"" Scotland's fishermen.The PM also said she regretted saying in a speech last week that Brexit would prevent EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". The comments sparked an angry backlash from EU citizens living in the UK.How Corbyn and other MPs respondedThe Labour leader said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"" and that ""ploughing on is not stoic, it is an act of national self-harm"".He said the prime minister needed a ""plan B"" involving a permanent customs arrangement and stronger employment and environmental protections, which is Labour's Brexit policy. ""This deal it is not a plan for Britain's future,"" he added and that was why MPs had ""little choice"" but to reject it. Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal.""Caroline Flint, one of the few Labour MPs who have signalled they could vote for the deal, urged Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to hold face-to-face talks to reach an accommodation acceptable to both parties.A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had ""no plans"" to reach out personally to Labour MPs who might back a deal, although her chief of staff had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement on Monday evening.The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"".And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application.

But if this debate is a taste of things to come, the prime minister is in big trouble.  One MP after another, Remainers and Leavers alike, and across all parties, spoke out against Mrs May's plan.

"13 December 2023","Rishi Sunak sees off Tory rebellion in Rwanda bill vote","Rishi Sunak sees off Tory rebellion in Rwanda bill vote13 December 2023ShareBecky MortonPolitical reporterShareGetty ImagesPrime Minister Rishi Sunak has seen off a Tory rebellion over his flagship Rwanda bill but still faces a battle to get it through Parliament. The legislation comfortably passed its first Commons hurdle with a majority of 44, but there will be further votes in the new year.No Tory MPs voted against but some critics on the right of the party rebelled by abstaining.Rebels said they had been told the PM would consider ""tightening"" the bill.But this could risk losing the support of more centrist Tory MPs, who have warned they would oppose any future changes which would breach international law. The emergency legislation was drawn up to revive the government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The government say the scheme is designed to deter migrants from crossing the Channel in small boats - something Mr Sunak has made one of his key priorities.Chris Mason: Sunak takes the win but the battle is not overWhy does the UK want to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Can the new Rwanda bill work and what could stop it?In a sign of nerves in Downing Street over the potential for a tight result, Climate Minister Graham Stuart flew back from the COP28 climate conference in Dubai to vote. But despite some Tories on the right threatening to vote against the bill, in the end only opposition MPs did, and the bill passed by 313 votes to 269. Around 29 Conservative MPs -  including former Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick, who resigned over the legislation last week, and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - chose to abstain and not support the bill. Altogether 37 Tory MPs did not record a vote, however some of those may have simply been unable to attend the vote rather than deliberately abstaining. Shortly before the vote, five factions of backbench MPs - the European Research Group (ERG), the New Conservatives, the Common Sense Group, the Conservative Growth Group and Northern Research Group - announced they could not support the bill in its current form. They plan to propose amendments and said they could vote the bill down when it returns to the Commons in the new year if the changes they wanted were not accepted.Chairman of the ERG - a faction to the right of the party - Mark Francois, who was among those who abstained, told BBC News: ""Our objection was that we don't believe, as it's currently drafted, the bill is firm enough to ensure that flights will take off to Rwanda.""""The prime minister had said that he would entertain tightening up the bill. We're taking him at his word,"" he said.""A number of MPs voted with the government... because they were told in private that there would be amendments later on.""However, agreeing to their demands would create new problems for the government. The centrist One Nation group, which includes more than 100 Tory MPs, had recommended that its members vote for the bill, but warned it would oppose any future amendments ""that would mean the UK government breaching the rule of law and its international obligations"".Group member Matt Warman told the BBC's World Tonight programme: ""We don't want to see the bill change in a way that goes over the red lines of international law… anything that goes over those red lines is out of the question"". He added that ""there is a possibility for sensible compromise as we go into the next stages of this bill"".Tougher legislation may be more difficult to get through the House of Lords. One Nation Chairman Damian Green told BBC News the vote had seen far fewer abstentions than expected and that ""if the government sticks to its guns then it can probably get this legislation through intact"".Home Office Minister Chris Philp said the government would listen to ideas from MPs on how to improve the bill. ""Like with any bill, government ministers will be talking to members of Parliament to see if there are ways of tightening this even further, to improve the drafting to make sure there are absolutely no loopholes at all,"" he added. Watch: Why Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda bill battle is far from overBen Bradley MP of the Common Sense Group told BBC's Newsnight that ""pragmatism has got to meet ideology at some point. What is the strongest we can deliver versus what is perfect'.""The bill seeks to declare in UK law that Rwanda is a safe country to send asylum seekers to, after the Supreme Court ruled the policy was unlawful last month.However, critics on the right of the party have argued it is not currently strong enough to prevent legal challenges to deportations. A No 10 spokesperson said the bill was ""the toughest legislation ever introduced to Parliament"" and ""makes clear that this Parliament, not any foreign court is sovereign"". ""We will now work to ensure that this bill gets on to the statute book so that we can get flights off to Rwanda and stop the boats,"" the spokesperson added. Watch: Moment Sunak wins Rwanda voteLabour voted against the bill, along with other opposition parties, and the party has said it would scrap the Rwanda plan if it wins the next election. It says the millions of pounds given to Rwanda as part of the deal would be better spent tackling people-smuggling gangs.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""The Conservatives' civil war is continuing, and the country is paying the price for this chaos.

"25 June 2018","The long march of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party","The long march of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party25 June 2018ShareIain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC NewsShareGetty ImagesJeremy Corbyn salutes the crowds at Labour Live, the party's music and politics festival""Things can change - and they will."" A hopeful, positive message. Or a warning?These words were uttered by Labour's new leader Jeremy Corbyn at the special conference on 12 September 2015 when he decisively defeated the three other candidates.I was in the room at the Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre in central London - an odd place perhaps for a republican to be ""crowned"" party leader, perhaps.But it proved convenient for Jeremy Corbyn as it was within yards of a pro-refugee demonstration in Parliament Square which he addressed soon afterwards.His election was greeted by the strangest mixture of elation and trepidation. Three years on, and there is little doubt that he has changed his party.Speaking this month at the Labour Live event on home turf in north London he declared: ""The Labour Party is now 550,000 members - the biggest in my lifetime.""We are a proud and determined party. We need and can do things differently.""In the final edition of BBC Radio 4's documentary series The Long March of Corbyn's Labour I've looked at how the party's membership has changed, the implications of this for policy - and how a mass membership party can bring challenges as well as opportunities.March of the membersUnder a cut-price supporters' scheme introduced by Corbyn's predecessor Ed Miliband, people who had felt either alienated by mainstream politics or who had been to the left of the Labour leadership signed up to back the insurgent in the 2015 leadership contest.Once Corbyn was on the ballot, his campaign manager John McDonnell coined the phrase ""straight-talking honest politics"" - portraying him as a refreshing change from career politicians and the former ministers and special advisers who were his opponents.Having been an MP since 1983 and a councillor before that, it could of course be argued that Corbyn, too, was a career politician. But he looked and sounded different.And some of those who signed up to support him stayed on - becoming full members and, as it turned out, a bulwark against a sceptical - even hostile - Parliamentary Labour Party.Labour membership is falling back a bit now and confidential internal projections which we have seen - and which are used for financial planning purposes - predict it will decrease to around 500,000 by the end of the year.But this is still two-and-a-half times bigger than when the party boasted of its ""ground force"" in the disastrous 2015 election campaign.Soon after Corbyn's victory, a veteran of the party's left - Jon Lansman - was approached to set up, rather ambitiously, a whole new movement: Momentum. Lansman had been a key figure - nearly 40 years previously - in Tony Benn's campaign for Labour's deputy leadership.Momentum's aim in the short term was to ensure that Corbyn wasn't toppled.""It was founded out of his leadership campaign,"" Lansman said.""I was asked to do that job by John McDonnell, with the consent of Jeremy. As a result of that, we created something which looks actually very different from anything else on the Left - inside or outside of the Labour Party.""Corbyn initially put together a reasonably broad-based shadow cabinet but at local level, the party was changing.Lucy Powell  was chief of staff to Ed Miliband when he led Labour and, not long after he lost power, she witnessed a party in a state of metamorphosis. Labour historyLooking through Labour's archives with Manchester Central MP Lucy PowellI met her in her Manchester Central constituency - and chose as a rendezvous the People's History Museum on the banks of the River Irwell.Deep in the basement of the museum is where the Labour Party stores its national archives. Here you can see letters signed by Labour's first leader Keir Hardie (rather like contemporary leaders, he was drumming up financial support from the unions).In more recent correspondence, Peter Mandelson and pollster Philip Gould discussed a review of party policy under Neil Kinnock - a prototype of the New Labour project.Lucy Powell told me she brought Jeremy Corbyn here when she had, briefly, been in his shadow cabinet. Although already reshaping the party for the future, he was fascinated by its past.She told me: ""Jeremy's staff were having kittens because he had to go to another function. He just didn't want to leave.""The archive also contains records of disciplinary cases and expulsions - underlining that the party has been riven many times by factional struggles before.Sadly, the minutes of Parliamentary Labour Party meetings are closed for the next two decades so we can't read for ourselves of the fractious meetings between Corbyn and his sceptical MPs.EPAFestival-goers relax during Labour LiveLucy Powell herself left one of those meetings two years ago in some distress.She told me of the culture shock in her constituency when new members flooded in to support Jeremy Corbyn.""My constituency membership went up from 600 to 700 three years ago to over 2,300, it's now gone down a bit again.""It quadrupled in size, and that has brought great challenges as well as real opportunities... there was a bit of 'us and them' about it originally, with the older members calling newer members 'hard-left trots' and newer members calling the older members 'right-wing Blairites'.""Now though, she insists members are working more co-operatively together: ""We've definitely come through that and a lot of those relationships have now been established, but it was definitely difficult for a while.""John Stolliday was until this month one of Labour's most senior officials - the director of governance and legal.  He announced his resignation when Jeremy Corbyn's supporters tightened their grip on the party machine and installed a new general secretary, in overall charge of the party's head office.He joined Labour HQ 14 years ago, serving four party leaders - and had a broad overview of the changing nature of the party.The local battles being fought within LabourWhat Momentum’s wins might mean for Labour Momentum director wins Labour disputes roleGiving his first-ever interview, he described the rise in membership in 2015 as ""extraordinary.... no one saw it coming"".But who were these new members?""There were many young people who have never been members of political parties and who felt genuinely enthused by Jeremy and his message.""But, he explained, they weren't all political virgins.""There are many people who have joined from other political parties, from the Lib Dems, the Greens, the rag tag assortment of far-left parties and the Trade Union Socialist Coalition... and then also people who were members under Blair and then left because of the Iraq war.""And there is a bit of snag about where the new members are geographically, rather than politically.""They are concentrated in London and the south east of England. That's a problem.""For Labour to get into power, it absolutely has to win the constituencies with the smallest Tory majorities.""""They are in the Midlands and the M6 corridor in the North. They are home to many working class people.""And for some reason these people are not turning out to vote for the Labour Party - or indeed to join it.""But the new members were certainly in the right place at the right time for Jeremy Corbyn in Labour's internal battles.Putsch comes to shoveIn his first six months as leader, party membership was rising but Jeremy Corbyn's political stock was falling.Behind in the polls, he looked vulnerable. But it was an attempt to oust him that solidified him in power.After what was seen as at best a lacklustre campaign on his part to keep Britain in the EU in 2016, his internal opponents made a move - but also made a series of miscalculations.The Parliamentary Labour Party decided they had no confidence in their leader. Eighty per cent of MPs opposed him, and many of the better-known faces left his shadow cabinet. Two assumptions had been made by his critics, and both turned out be wrong. The first was that having lost the confidence of so many of his MPs Corbyn would feel under a certain responsibility to resign.Getty ImagesJeremy Corbyn comfortably saw off Owen Smith's leadership challenge in 2016There seems little doubt he considered this, but those close to him say he didn't want to let down the members who had elected him. The second was that - in line with legal advice party officials had obtained - if his leadership was challenged, he would need 20% of MPs and MEPs - around 50 elected politicians - to nominate him to get on the ballot paper. It was assumed this would be too high a threshold to meet.In fact, in the end Labour's national executive - which wasn't under his full control at that moment - narrowly voted to put him on the ballot automatically without the need for nominations, and a subsequent legal challenge to this failed.Compounding this, his opponents couldn't agree a candidate and there was an internal contest within the parliamentary party between Angela Eagle and Owen Smith.Lucy Powell - one of those who resigned from Corbyn's shadow cabinet - regrets the move: ""It was a really big mistake. It was a collective misjudgement of what action should have been taken at the time.""It wasn't a plan. In fact if it had been a plan, it would have been a rubbish plan. It was a domino effect that took hold really, really quickly.""And John Stolliday also believes that emotion rather than wisdom prevailed. Membership had been falling from its peak and he thinks some of the newer members may have gone - or lost interest  - if a leadership contest had come later: ""I understand why the challenge came. But the MPs who led that challenge seemed to not realise the strength of feeling amongst the membership.""They forgot that many members of the Labour Party joined in 2015 to support Jeremy Corbyn.""When people joined the Labour Party they join on a year's contract.""For many people that would have expired in the summer, members were already dropping off by the time of the referendum in June.""The effect of the challenge… was to invigorate and electrify members.""Left foot forwardThis was the Left's moment. The push against Corbyn was portrayed as a putsch -  a coup against the membership. And Jon Lansman, Momentum's founder, said the Left could no longer be quite so relaxed about who controlled the levers of power in the party.""We expected it to come. And whilst Jeremy set out to be inclusive, we prepared for it.""Momentum was initially riven with factional strife - and a debilitating debate over whether its activists also had to be fully paid-up Labour members.As Lansman put it: ""Any start-up organisation goes through a painful period of creating itself.""But with a threat to Corbyn, enmities could be buried or shelved - and those on the Left could come together in common cause.That summer, Jeremy Corbyn played to his strengths - and played to the crowds - at leadership rallies. Momentum managed an impressive social media campaign. Pop acts and Corbynistas rubbed shoulders at Labour LiveAnd he was re-elected with a higher share of the vote. A victory for Jeremy Corbyn but also for Momentum.Jon Lansman was delighted: ""We raised a great deal of money. We only had two or three thousand members before the coup. We came out of it with 20,000. We now have more than double that.""But a former Labour leader, Lord Kinnock - who had started out on the Left - felt too much time had been spent by Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters on changing his party rather than looking outwards to change the country.""I would say that Jeremy, and I doubt that he would disagree with this, comes from a segment in British politics, in Labour politics that has always existed, and is largely composed of people who give a higher priority to power in the Labour Party than power for the Labour Party.""And if they're ideologues it means that they have a convenient life because it means they only have to make a decision once in their life.""You can't drive a car or bring up a family like that. I don't think it is the reality of life.""But even after Corbyn's second leadership election, elements of the party machine - including crucially the national executive - weren't fully in his hands.That came later - after the 2017 general election.Although some seats were won by Labour MPs who publicly distanced themselves from Corbyn's leadership, the massive increase in the share of the vote led to the abandonment of two putative leadership challenges and from this point on, many of his internal opponents kept their heads down and their tongues bitten.John Stolliday says there was an active debate about broadening the political base of the shadow cabinet, but it didn't happen: ""There was an opportunity straight after the 2017 election for Jeremy Corbyn to look at the issues facing this country and to say 'I need the full range of talents of this party and that includes the senior and serious figures, the former ministers, who are on the backbenches now'. ""Jeremy had an opportunity to put these people in to his shadow cabinet and to say 'this is a united, unified party'.""Unfortunately he chose to reject that - and decided to instead reward loyalists and loyalty.""Indeed Jeremy Corby's supporters tightened rather than relaxed their grip following the election. Behind-the-scenes changes were resisted in a token fashion at best.As a senior figure in the parliamentary party confided off the record: ""The lunatics have taken over the asylum, it's just a game of survival for most of us - we are ploughing our own furrows and waiting for the madness to pass.""Levers of powerTo reflect the much-expanded membership, three new seats were added to Labour's national executive, or NEC - and all three of these new positions were taken by members of Momentum, including its founder Jon Landsman.John Stolliday explained the importance of Labour's NEC: ""In the Labour Party, control of the NEC means that you control every decision that happens internally.""So, whether it's picking the longlist or shortlist for a by-election to see which candidate is going to be selected, whether it's deciding the party's priorities, the rule changes that will happen at conference, every decision is made by the NEC - control of the NEC is absolutely vital.""Another less well-known body has also had a change of management. The former GMTV political editor and MP Gloria De Piero and the former Eastender and Labour peer Michael Cashman - seen as supporters of New Labour - were outvoted as members of the Conference Arrangements Committee by the left-wing former trade union leader Billy Hayes and a community worker and constituency activist from Tottenham in north London, Seema Chandwani.  The committee influences what is discussed and when at Labour's annual gathering. Seema Chandwani is a member of Momentum and a left-wing group with a longer pedigree  - the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. She saw this as a victory for democracy after many years in which, she believes, the Left had been kept well away from the reins of power, as well as a consequence of the expanded - and younger - membership.""These weren't random Martians coming from Planet Momentum. These were people who are active in our communities.""It struck a modicum of fear in some of the current members who were saying 'oh, we are going back to the eighties'.""But I said, what happened in the eighties? I was four in the eighties.""So important parts of Labour's machinery are now operated from the Left. But not everything has changed.Swathes of the Parliamentary Labour Party - while cowed  - remain sceptical of Corbyn's leadership. One senior figure told me ""the Corbyn phase will be over - when we lose the next election"". He believes we have seen ""peak Corbyn"".But as the 2017 result proved, the political future can be difficult to predict.And there are further changes to the Labour Party being planned in the name of empowering the mass membership.A ""democracy review"" is in full flight.Both Momentum and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are suggesting that the way the party's parliamentary candidates are selected should change, making it easier for party members at local level to trigger contests rather than re-adopting a sitting MP on the nod.This isn't, however, what's often referred to as mandatory reselections - effectively requiring MPs to get the backing of members in every parliament.The Left hasn't exactly been overwhelmingly successful at getting its candidates selected under the current system. The new MP for Lewisham East - elected this month - was not backed by Momentum or the influential left-wing Unite trade union.Local councillor Janet Daby was supported by groups that would once have been described as Brownite and Blairite - the campaign groups Labour First and Progress - though it's a measure of how the party has moved to the left that Janet Daby is now regarded as a ""moderate"". She voted for Jeremy Corbyn in both leadership contests.Lucy Powell said: ""I don't think you can see Momentum as a homogenous force sweeping the party. They are more effective when they are mobilising people online.""When it comes to local selections they have been much less effective because usually what people go for tend to go for a good strong committed local person.""Trying to parachute in a Momentum or Unite-favoured candidate doesn't work.""Getty ImagesNew Lewisham East MP Janet Daby was not the preferred choice of Momentum or UniteFor Jon Lansman, though, time and effort will deliver. Perspiration is as important as inspiration for him: ""The party is a fundamentally different party and is committed to radical change.""The effect of having so many new members will eventually flow through. It hasn't got there yet.""Local government is hardly touched by the new membership, with the exception of one or two authorities.""We're still in the early days of trickling through the system.""For local government and then for Parliament - because you select a proportion of candidates every time - that will flow through.""I don't think there is any going back.""Momentum is running training sessions for new councillors, who in turn may become MPs.'That's democracy'But even if the make-up of the Parliamentary Labour Party doesn't change dramatically in the short term, its power is set to diminish further.In 2015, candidates for the party leadership needed to demonstrate support from 15% of MPs and MEPs.This was reduced to 10% at last year's Labour conference.And now the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy wants the ability to shut out politicians from this process entirely.They are suggesting - when the time comes and Corbyn goes - that any candidate who wants to replace him would simply need to have the support of 10% of constituencies, or 10% of affiliated trade unions to avoid the need to have the backing of one in 10 of the parliamentary party.Seema Chandwani explained the thinking: ""You have got these shortlisting gatekeepers called MPs who have been elected to have that role.""From the perspective of the lay-member, should there really be any type of gate-keeping to get on the ballot paper?""The leader of the Labour Party is there not as the property of the MPs, they are the property of the whole party.""I asked her if these rule changes were more likely to result in a successor to Jeremy Corbyn who was just as left wing. She responded: ""It would be more likely that his successor is somebody members want. And if somebody they want is more Left, then that's democracy.""Radicalism versus realityJeremy Corbyn called his 2017 general election manifesto the star of the campaign and it's clear that Labour would tax more and spend more - those earning more than £80,000 and big corporations would pay more tax, and some services in private hands - such as the water industry in England and Wales - would be returned to the public sector.Many of the newer members in particular are delighted to see clear red water separating the opposition from the government.But there are fears that the enthusiasm of a mass membership could turn to disappointment - disillusion even - if the party doesn't deliver quickly enough on the pledges that Jeremy Corbyn recites at party rallies.One council that is already in the Momentum mould is Salford in Greater Manchester. Its mayor Paul Dennett is a strong supporter of Jeremy Corbyn. He shares his leader's passion for housing - and council housing in particular.The local authority has set up a housing company that embodies radicalism in its name. It's called Derive. But it's pronounced Dereeve.Getty ImagesSalford in Greater Manchester, where the council has set up its own housing companyThe name was derived (not dereeved) from Guy Debord, a member of the Paris-based Marxist Situationist collective, the Lettrist International - which, naturally enough, split from the Letterists - in the Fifties. It's all about designing urban environments around emotion and human behaviour.But looking at the company's construction plans in the mayor's office, the housing probably owes a bit more to Brookside than Bauhaus.The development that's getting under way is a mix of housing for rent, shared ownership and home for sale.This is hardly a return to the days when the ultra-left Militant Tendency (or Revolutionary Socialist League) controlled Liverpool Council, culminating - as then Labour leader Neil Kinnock put it in 1985 - ""in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council - a Labour council - hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers"".Dennett, a Momentum member, has coined a term for his rather different approach: ""It's what I would refer to as sensible socialism. It's a pragmatic response to the context in which we find ourselves.""That isn't to say we're not trying to change the system.""With eight- yes, eight - new rented homes in the pipeline he knows he is making only a modest start but believes when a Labour government ends austerity, it will be possible to play his part fully in delivering the party's million homes pledge. For now he is giving a glimpse of the possible - erecting a signpost to a future direction. But he also has to work hard to manage the expectations of party members.""This is a continual challenge,"" he says.""I regularly attend branch meetings and we have got party members who see the manifesto and want me to implement it as quickly as I possibly can. ""It's been interesting to go through some of the policy and resource complexity with party members and in terms of their expectations around delivery they become more realistic.""If this is a challenge locally, the shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne - also Labour's joint election co-ordinator - knows it could be a nightmare nationally.""What gives me sleepless nights is that so many of the big ticket promises in Labour's manifesto will be down to local government to deliver,"" he tells me.""The worry for me is the ability and capacity of local councils to be able to deliver.""Hope or disappointmentBehind the scenes in Whitehall, Labour has been preparing for government - with each shadow departmental team being given advice by the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake.Andrew Gwynne believes the party needs a clearer plan, and to be honest about which parts of Labour's manifesto can't be delivered swiftly if hope isn't to be eclipsed by disappointment.""It's going to take time to overcome eight years or more of Tory austerity. It is going to take time to build up capacity in central government, it is going to take time to build up capacity in local government and we've got to ensure that we have that right mix of offering hope and optimism and people being able to see change, but also not disappointing that change hasn't been quick enough or radical enough.""He also warns of the dangers if Labour fails to reconcile aspirations with the art of the possible.""If we come to power on the back of massive optimism, a new way of doing things, and we fall at the first hurdle then it will be very difficult to recover.""Getty ImagesFormer Labour leader Lord Kinnock says the party has to ""compromise"" with the electorateLord Kinnock - as Neil Kinnock - began as a protégé of left-wing Labour leader Michael Foot in the 1980s. But as he moved to the centre, the party picked up support.He is urging the current leadership to ""compromise"" further with the electorate if its 40% at the last election is to be a building block not a ceiling.He thinks this may mean that party membership falls a bit, with some people drifting off to protest groups, but the prize would be wider support.""There has to be compromise with the electorate. And if the electorate isn't supporting you - you can't invent another one.""You have to deal with the people that exist, that have needs and hopes, and serve those needs and hopes in a way they can comprehend and can embrace.""United we stand?There have also been unanticipated consequences of a mass membership.Sometimes in politics arguments emerge over means rather than ends.The leadership of both the country's biggest union, Unite, and Momentum wanted to see Labour move to the Left, and to keep Jeremy Corbyn at the helm.But there are differences over personnel - and how to preserve the leader's legacy. For many in Momentum - some of whom haven't risen through the ranks of 'organised labour' - a more democratic party that shifts power to the members is the best way of ensuring Labour remains on the Left.If this or that left-wing union general secretary were to be ousted, they fear the party - or at least its machine - in turn could drift to the the right.For example, the left-wing Unite leader Len McCluskey faced a leadership challenge last year, and then a legal challenge to his victory. Had he been removed the left-wing delegates he in effect appoints to Labour's ruling national executive could also have been replaced.A sign of this tension was when, briefly this spring, Momentum's Jon Lansman declared he would apply for the post of the party's most senior official - the general secretary. In doing so he was defying the party leadership who wanted to install the Unite official Jennie Formby.He later withdrew, telling me he simply wanted to see a ""proper process"".But these tensions have surfaced again recently - in Wales.Labour' s leader in the principality, the first minister Carwyn Jones, has announced he will stand down in the autumn.There is now a battle not so much over who should succeed him, but how his successor should be chosen - though the latter could determine the former.The method of selection is an ""electoral college"" giving unions and elected politicians two thirds of the vote and consigning grassroots members to one third.There will now be a hastily-arranged special conference in September to decide whether these rules should be changed - and those on the left in particular are calling for the power of selection to be in the hands of the rank and file. Darren Williams - a left-wing member both of Labour's ruling national executive and its Welsh executive - insists that changing the leadership rules is about more than faction-fighting.""Some of the resistance to a one member one vote contest in Wales comes from people who assume that [it] is more likely to favour a left-wing, pro-Corbyn candidate but I think there are arguments just based on which is the more democratic system.""PAUnite leader Len McCluskey - handing out ice creams at Labour Live - saw off a leadership challenge last yearBut four big unions are resisting this move.       Mike Payne, of the GMB union in Wales, is warning that weakening the union voice in a leadership contest could have unintended consequences: ""The trade unions have always been the consistent body within the party that keeps it stable.""If you take away the voice of organised labour then the party becomes a mile away  from working people on a day to day basis and becomes remote.'        The UK leader is already chosen by the members but John Stolliday expects similar underlying tensions to become more apparent: ""There is a fundamental conflict Labour has to face in the next year or so.""Whether it is a party of the membership or of the trade unions and those who created it. It's almost an existential problem.""There is a delicate balance... it becomes more of a tyranny of the majority if one side gets to rule the roost.""Seema Chandwani has a foot in both camps - an activist in her constituency and with her union, Unite,She says: ""Who is in charge of the party - members or the affiliated organisations? That's been there pre-Corbyn and there is always going to be that tension of how do people maintain and use power.""I am not going to tell you there isn't going to be that tension or it's all going to be lovely.""Out of step on the long marchAnd the leadership is challenged when the mass membership aren't quite in step with them.The Labour Live event this month wasn't a sell-out, politically or in terms of tickets. There were a few exceptions, but it was overwhelmingly attended by staunch supporters - admirers, even - of Jeremy Corbyn.But many also sported fluorescent stickers opposing, with rather colourful language, Brexit.Getty ImagesSome Labour Live attendees voiced their displeasure at Labour's approach to BrexitA survey of party members carried out by Queen Mary University and YouGov suggested more than eight in 10 members supported staying in the single market - something Jeremy Corbyn hasn't, and possibly won't, endorse.Some of those wearing the stickers said they were simply expressing ""disappointment"" at Brexit, and not at the position of the party leadership.But Brexit is an issue which cuts across left/right lines - with even some grassroots members of Momentum calling for a new referendum.Jon Lansman explains the difficulty: ""It's very difficult to navigate - to win elections we need to take people with us with a range of views on Brexit.""So far Jeremy has done that extremely well. It may get more difficult.""Whatever the tensions over specific issues - proof, John McDonnell would contend, that the party leadership doesn't suppress what he calls ""robust debate"" - those on the left would argue that the political ground is shifting and that the membership are united by their radicalism.Getty ImagesTime and again, leading Labour figures including Jeremy Corbyn use the word ""transformation"". They don't just want to change this or that tax rate, they really do want to change society.Many would buy into a concept popularised - if that's the word - by the Italian politician and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, who developed his thinking in the 1930s when he was imprisoned by Mussolini's regime.He argued that the ruling class exercised ""cultural hegemony"" - in effect that they imbued society with their assumptions, which became the received wisdom.So it wasn't surprising Labour Live was billed as a cultural as well as a political festival.Labour's leadership believe they have overturned what they term ""the neo-liberal consensus"" and have challenged the efficacy and morality of austerity.Jon Lansman believes that if a left-wing government does take power - despite all the constraints set out by Andrew Gwynne - vested interests will resist.And it's at this point Momentum will prove its true worth, he says.""We want to make a significant transformation. We want decisions which affect jobs and livelihoods democratised. The global corporations will resist. Other governments have faced challenges like runs on the pound. And we may face similar things. I hope we don't.""The people who are opposed to doing what we want to do have one thing in their favour - money. We have people.""We need the power of people to overcome the power of money.""The changing manOf course, it's possible Jeremy Corbyn won't make it to Downing Street - that the clash of people and corporations just doesn't happen.But the party he presides over has already changed.And those around him are unsurprisingly confident that some of the changes that have been wrought in the past few years are likely to be permanent.It was a relaxed shadow chancellor I encountered at Labour Live. John McDonnell was in open-necked shirt, stopping to chat with journalists and supporters.He told me that even if he and Jeremy Corbyn were to depart the scene Labour would remain an anti-austerity party - and ""there will be no triangulation"", where the main parties compete on similar territory.""That has gone now,"" he tells me.His close political ally Jon Lansman is confident, too, there is no going back to the politics of the Blair/Brown era.""The party has fundamentally changed,"" he says.""We're not going to go back to neo-liberalism, we're not going back to privatising the health service. That's decided forever. Well, for a generation or two.""But a measure of how the party has changed is that many of those who didn't back Jeremy Corbyn for leader are recognising this too.John Stolliday - who joined Labour's head office under Tony Blair - believes the current leader has a stronger grip on the levers of power than New Labour's founder and frontman.Momentum supporter Owen Jones and Progress director Richard Angell on Labour candidate selectionHe said: ""Blair controlled the party through the popular weight of his determination to get into power, and people were willing because he won power so overwhelmingly in 1997.""Jeremy has uniquely managed to get hold of not just the membership of the party, but also of the NEC and the party structures.""No leader has ever controlled all the levers of power at the Labour Party before.""And Lucy Powell - Ed Miliband's former chief of staff who subsequently worked on Andy Burnham's failed leadership bid - agreed. ""Jeremy can be the leader for as long as he wants to be. No-one is going to challenge that at all. We just need  to get on with the job we're all elected to do.""But, she adds, ""with power comes responsibility"".Others at grassroots level, groups that were more comfortable with the pre-Corbyn era - Progress and Labour First - continue to try to combat control by the Left.Their members are not Marxists. They don't believe anything is historically inevitable.

"24 January 2024","Why Tory rows are back on display","Why Tory rows are back on display24 January 2024ShareChris MasonPolitical editor, BBC News•@ChrisMasonBBCShareGetty ImagesSir Simon Clarke said the Conservatives needed a leader who ""shares the instincts of the majority""Not even a week on from the last blast of noisy public rowing in the Conservative Party - here they go again.Sir Simon Clarke, a former cabinet minister, has become the second Tory MP to publicly call for Rishi Sunak to go. Dame Andrea Jenkyns was the first, late last year.So what does this intervention mean?If I had drawn up a list a week ago of those most likely to publicly call for the prime minister to pack it in, Sir Simon would have been pretty near, if not at the top.He has been publicly critical for some time. He was one of the 11 rebels in the crunch Rwanda vote last week. He backed Mr Sunak's leadership rival Liz Truss early on and served in her cabinet.Nonetheless, it is still quite a moment when an MP goes public like this - and is critical in the strongest possible terms.It is quite a moment because they know what their remarks will provoke - another almighty row.Sir Simon has said as much, as he shared a link to his article in the Daily Telegraph.""I know I will be attacked for saying this. Perhaps even accused of positioning myself or on behalf of another - emphatically neither of which I am doing. I am speaking out because the stakes for our country and my party are too high to stay silent.""Can Rishi Sunak halt growing Tory poll panic?Rwanda bill passes but poll gloom still haunts PMThe main Tory factions jostling for influenceSure enough, being strongly criticised by fellow Conservatives is precisely what is now happening.Sir Simon's article picks up on the conclusions of a poll published by the Telegraph which suggests while Mr Sunak would be heavily defeated in a general election by Sir Keir Starmer, a Conservative leader willing to be tougher on immigration and focused on tax cuts could beat Labour.The poll was commissioned, the Telegraph said, by a group called the Conservative Britain Alliance. The Tory peer Lord Frost, another noted critic of Rishi Sunak, worked on it too.The public backlash was instant: two knights and a dame, all three former cabinet ministers, going for Sir Simon: Sir David Davis, Sir Liam Fox and Dame Priti Patel variously calling his actions ""silly,"" ""self indulgent,"" ""facile"" and ""divisive.""Getty ImagesVeteran Tory MP David Davis took to social media to say the party and UK are ""sick and tired of MPs putting their own leadership ambitions ahead of the UK's best interests""A senior Conservative spokesman added ""this is a self-indulgent attempt to undermine the government at a critical moment for the country. He may claim to be helping the party but the only person he is doing any favours for is Sir Keir Starmer"".But let's be clear: Sir Simon is not the only Conservative MP who reads the current situation for the Tories as he does.As one ally put it: ""This is about one brave MP speaking the truth. What everyone knows but won't say out loud. Rishi is killing the party's chance of a respectable election result. Others will take their time to think about the arguments and party's options.""The big question now is this: do any others, who share his views privately, go public in a steady drip-drip designed to undermine Rishi Sunak and so sap his authority, his credibility? Or does it fizzle out?ReutersRishi Sunak has hinted at a general election ""in the second half of this year""If you have a penchant for - a relatively recent - historical comparison, rewind 14 years.Two former Labour cabinet ministers, Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon, called on Gordon Brown to go, but the whole thing petered out.It didn't end well for Gordon Brown some months later at the general election, but the attempt to topple him didn't end well either.Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, though, would say you don't need a decade-and-a-half of political memory to recall moments more recent when momentum did build, for the latter quickly, for the former much more slowly, which in the end did do for them.One senior Conservative figure remarked to me the other day while it looks like the imminent election will spell doom for Rishi Sunak, its very imminence is his best friend in protecting his job between now and then. It was, this figure thought, too late for the party to change leader yet again and for any replacement to make any mark other than making the party look ridiculous.  Well, let's see where this goes.  One last thing. I wrote here last week the Conservative election strategist Issac Levido had pleaded with MPs ""divided parties fail. It is time to get serious"".The divisions were never going to go away. But, they are back on public display yet again - and for a simple reason. Conservative MPs are worried they are going to lose and, quite possibly, lose big time.So they are stewing. Don't make it worse, say some. It can't get any worse, fear others - Sir Simon Clarke among them. That is what we are now seeing play out, privately - and in public.

The bill has now cleared its first hurdle in the upper chamber. Key votes on the legislation in the Lords are not expected until next month.Any changes made by peers are likely to be overturned by the Commons.The government is hoping to get the flights to Rwanda running by the spring.'Shoddy' billDuring the debate, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the bill was ""damaging"" to the UK's reputation, to ""national unity"" and to asylum seekers ""who are in need of protection"".This bill ""obscures the truth that all people, asylum seekers included, are of great value"" he said.The archbishop said he would not vote against the bill at second reading, but told peers the UK ""can do better"".Labour's former home secretary Lord David Blunkett called the bill ""shoddy and less than this country deserves"".Lord Blunkett argued the Rwanda Bill fails its main purpose because it ""punishes"" asylum seekers, not smuggling gangs.To stop smuggling boats, Lord Blunkett said Britain needs to ""get its act together"" by securing borders, processing claims and making new deals with the French.However, Conservative Lord Hannan, a former MEP, said the bill was ""imperfect"" but was part of a ""package of measures"" that would act as a deterrent, curbing the demand for illegal migration to the UK.Former minister and Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost expressed support for the bill, arguing that the government was ""right to do what is necessary to re-establish control"" over illegal immigration. ""We have no obligation to take in just anybody who shows up.""Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Ken Clarke said the bill would endanger the UK's constitution.Declaring Rwanda a safe country is ""trying to overturn"" the facts found by the Supreme Court, which ruled the country was unsafe for asylum seekers, he said. The government might as well rule ""all dogs are cats"", he added.Crossbench peer and leading lawyer Lord Carlile said there was ""plenty of evidence that Rwanda is not a safe country"" and the government was ""asking us to legislate a lie"". The former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation said he would only support the bill if concerns raised by peers about Rwanda's asylum procedures were resolved. Ahead of the debate, Downing Street insisted the Rwanda Bill was the ""right thing to do"".The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This bill is a key part of how we stop violent criminal gangs targeting vulnerable people that has led to too many deaths in the English Channel.""It is also the fair thing to do both for taxpayers and for those individuals seeking to come here through safe and legal routes who see their place jumped by those who can afford to make crossings on small boats.""Tory divisionsThe prime minister was able to pass the bill through the Commons after a threatened Conservative rebellion failed to materialise.Mr Sunak has argued deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda will be a deterrent to migrants seeking to get to the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats, but Labour has labelled the plan an expensive ""gimmick"".Debate over the legislation has exposed on-going divisions among Conservatives - leading to two deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, quitting their roles in order to vote for the rebel amendments.In the final round of voting in the Commons on 18 January, more than 60 Conservative MPs backed rebel amendments to allow the UK government to ignore parts of human rights law when sending people to Rwanda.Dozens of Tory MPs had suggested they would be willing to abstain or even vote against the entire bill without fundamental changes.However, in the event, just 11 MPs voted against it - including former immigration minister Robert Jenrick and former Home Secretary Suella Braverman.The votes were a culmination of months of Conservative party infighting and coincided with a poll funded by an anonymous group called Conservative Britain Alliance - which projected Labour was on course for a 120-seat majority.Tory pollster Lord Hayward has called for the Electoral Commission to look into polls pushed by groups with no credible identifiable ""beneficial owner"".UK immigrationRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakRwandaHouse of Lords","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68126734"

Sajid Javid is chairing talks in London later after agreeing a joint action plan with the French interior minister.On Monday morning, Border Force officers were called to Greatstone, Kent, after a group of 12 migrants were spotted.Since November, a total of 239 people have reached the UK by boat. PAMr Javid has come under growing pressure to act, and has returned from a family holiday in South Africa to address the issue.Following a call with his French counterpart, Christophe Castaner, the pair agreed an ""enhanced action plan"" to be put in place in the coming week.It includes increasing joint patrols and surveillance, disrupting organised trafficking gangs and raising awareness among migrants of the dangers of a Channel crossing.Reality Check: How many people seek asylum in the UK?UK and France to step up Channel patrolsWhy are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? People smugglers 'rush to beat Brexit'The Home Office did not give information on how this would be done.Some MPs - including Conservative backbenchers - have criticised a lack of detail, as well as calling for more Border Force patrol boats to be deployed.Mr Javid said the complex factors behind the rise in numbers of people attempting the Channel crossing included instability in the Middle East, organised crime and tighter security at Calais. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: ""The reasons behind the increased crossings are complicated and in many cases outside of our control.""""Unfortunately, this means that there are no easy answers,"" he wrote. ""So our response is focused both here in the UK and abroad.""0:56The dinghy appeared to be taking in water as it approached the coastA meeting between Mr Javid, the Border Force, the National Crime Agency (NCA), Whitehall officials and other agencies was held on Monday to discuss what further action could be taken.

The prime minister's spokeswoman said the Border Force had increased the number of ""smaller and more agile"" coastal patrol boats deployed across the south-east coast in recent months. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke has repeated calls for Border Force cutters to be called back from search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean to patrol the Channel.The Home Office has not said whether any of them would return. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the armed forces were ready to offer help if needed.Mr Elphicke welcomed the cooperation between France and the UK but said ""it falls short of the kind of joint action and operations needed on the English Channel - specifically for the immediate return to France of people making illegal crossings"". PA'Hand of humanity'Six more Iranian men were found on a beach near Dover on Sunday morning.The NCA said French authorities prevented a further attempt to cross the Channel on Saturday night.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a tweet: ""We have a duty to reach out the hand of humanity, support and friendship to people who are in danger and seeking a place of safety.""Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Mr Javid of exploiting the problem.She told the Guardian: ""There's no question that, with Brexit and also with the approach of the meaningful vote in January, people are being whipped up about migration issues, because the government thinks this is the best way of frightening people to vote for their deal."" Pierre-Henri Dumont, MP for Calais, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme smugglers were using ""the uncertainty of Brexit"" to ""spread fake news"" to migrants, telling them that this was the best time to attempt the crossing. He also called for closer co-operation between France and the UK to ""dismantle smugglers' associations"". A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

But these gaps could be filled by reintegrating long-term unemployed back into the labour market as part of a £2.5bn overhaul of the benefits system. Given the size of the net migration numbers, it is understood Mr Jenrick believes the government has to consider radical policy changes if the figures are, eventually, to fall. He has suggested stopping those working in health and social care from bringing dependents with them to the UK.Another idea is to put a cap on visas for people working in social care.But this would probably meet resistance from the Department of Health. There has been an increase in workers arriving with visas to fill chronic staff shortages in the NHS and social care, the Office for National Statistics says.Mr Jenrick has also suggested scrapping what is known as the Shortage Occupation List, which highlights jobs that employers are struggling to fill.The Migration Advisory Committee - an independent body that advises the government on migration issues - recommended the abolition of the list earlier this month.Despite repeated questions, the prime ministers official spokesman refused to address Mr Jenrick's proposals. Instead Downing Street has insisted the government's current plans would have a ""significant impact"" on migration figures. Migration has been a continuing theme to the Conservatives' 13 years in office, since 2010.When the now Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron was prime minister, he promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands.It is a pledge that has never come close to being met and became a motivating factor for some to back Brexit.Speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative conference this October, Mr Jenrick said: ""Where I think we have gone wrong, immediately after leaving the EU we established a legal migration system that was, if anything, even more liberal than the system we had when we were in the EU.""He added that the government had been ""quite naive about the consequences in terms of numbers"".'Do or die'Mr Sunak is coming under pressure from within his party to reduce migration numbers. Earlier, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman - who worked alongside Mr Jenrick until she was sacked 10 days ago - criticised the government's record on immigration and said the figures were a ""slap in the face to the British public who have voted to control and reduce migration at every opportunity"". Setting out her own ideas for reducing immigration, Mrs Braverman has called for an annual cap on net migration and the raising of the salary threshold outside health and social care to £45,000 a year.It is understood Mrs Braverman and Mr Jenrick had jointly submitted ideas to No 10 when she was home secretary.Following her sacking, Mr Jenrick has since gone back to Downing Street, with a similar but pared-down set of ideas he hopes Prime Minister Rishi Sunak might accept.Downing Street is yet to comment on the proposals.Other Tory MPs have also called for more action to bring down migration. The New Conservatives group, on the Tory right, has described the issue as ""do or die"" for the party.Writing in his Daily Mail column, former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the minimum income for most migrant workers should be increased to at least £40,000.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said ""shockingly high"" net migration represented ""a failure not just of immigration, but also of asylum and of the economy"".Provisional figures to June of this year suggest the rate of net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK and those leaving - may now be slowing. The vast majority arriving were from countries outside the European Union, with students accounting for the largest group of non-EU migrants - also true of last year.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Net migration in 2022 revised up to record 745,000Braverman hits out after record migration figuresConservative PartyRobert JenrickUK immigrationKeir StarmerSuella BravermanRishi SunakOffice for National Statistics","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67515674"

Eleven of the town's 60 councillors are now independents, while the Liberal Democrats' position was unchanged, with them still having six councillors.No party has had overall control in Bolton since Labour ceded its majority five years ago.In Salford, Labour remained dominant, with 49 of the city's 60 councillors, with the remainder being eight Tories, two Lib Dems and one independent.The party comfortably retained Manchester and Trafford, winning in 30 and 31 seats respectively, while in Tameside, it took two seats from the Conservatives and one from the Green Party to hold 51 of the 57 seats. It also added three seats to its majority in Rochdale, with the Middleton Independents losing two seats while the Conservatives lost one.  The party also kept hold of Bury, taking two extra seats, one from the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats each, and comfortably held Wigan, with 61 seats.However, in Oldham, its overall victory included losing three seats, one each to the Conservatives, Lib Dems and an independent.One of those losses was Amanda Chadderton, who became the third council leader in three years to lose their seat.In Stockport, the Lib Dems were the largest single party, but fell short of a majority by two seats.Analysis by Kevin Fitzpatrick, Greater Manchester political reporter, BBC NewsIt was a night not even the optimists in Bolton's Labour party had been predicting as they replaced the Conservatives as the borough's largest party.The Conservatives' leader suggested a year of chaos in the national party had made the swing against them inevitable. Bolton's famous for its hyper-local parties and they generally held their own while the Horwich and Blackrod First Independents shot up from two councillors to six.  Bolton was the only Conservative-led council in Greater Manchester and will be seen as a key battleground at the next general election.As Labour begins discussions about leading a new minority administration, this result will have pleased them and worried the Tories in equal measure.Asked whether he expected to lead Bolton Council, Labour's Nick Peel told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he would ask the independent parties and the Liberal Democrats not to ""prop up a lame duck Tory administration that has now been rejected"".""If they do that, then yes, I do expect to form an administration,"" he said.Mr Peel added that the result had been ""bittersweet"" for his party.""We made nine gains but we just lost two to the independents in Horwich, so it's a net increase of seven,"" he said.""Clearly where it was a Labour versus Conservative battleground, we've done very well, [but] where we were up against independents, less so.""We were aware of this during the campaign and failed to get our message across that it was the independents who were propping up a Conservative council.""Labour has replaced the Conservatives as the largest party on Bolton CouncilIt was a resoundingly successful night for Horwich and Blackrod First Independents, who gained seats from both Labour and Conservatives to win all six seats up for grabs in that area.Group leader David Grant said the people of Horwich had ""shown they will not go along with the rhetoric of the main parties"". ""They have put faith in localism as they have seen it work with the two previous councillors and wanted to see what we could do with six,"" he said.""This will give us a platform to get investment into Horwich and Blackrod and give us a bigger say.""Mr Grant said that in four years, Labour had not had discussions with his party and that ""the ball is in their court if they want to speak to us"".Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

"15 April 2022","Rwanda asylum seekers: UK could send first people 'within weeks'","Rwanda asylum seekers: UK could send first people 'within weeks'15 April 2022ShareShareReutersThe scheme will initially focus on single men crossing the Channel in boats or lorries from FranceThe first asylum seekers could be flown to Rwanda from the UK within weeks, the government has said.It follows the announcement of a pilot that will see people sent to the east African country to claim asylum there. That scheme will initially focus on single men crossing the Channel in boats or lorries from France.The prime minister said it would ""save countless lives"" and break the business model of traffickers, but campaigners have called the plan ""inhumane"".Two more migrant crossings were recorded on Friday morning despite thick fog, the BBC's Simon Jones said.  Andrew Griffith MP - director of the No 10 policy unit - said the new scheme would not require new legislation and could be implemented under ""existing conventions"".He told BBC Newsnight it could therefore be launched ""in weeks or a small number of months"".He added that, if the flow of illegal migration could be stopped, it would leave ""lots of capacity for the very generous safe and legal routes"" into the UK.Is Rwanda a land of safety or fear?Analysis: Rwanda deal does what no country has done beforeWhich other countries send asylum seekers overseas?The Rwanda scheme is part of a broader strategy to reduce the number of people entering the UK by crossing the Channel in small boats.The Royal Navy has taken operational command of the Channel from UK Border Force in an effort to detect every boat headed to the UK.Some 562 people on 14 boats made the journey on the day the new scheme was announced, according to the Ministry of Defence. No one making the crossing is believed to have arrived on UK soil ""on their own terms"", it added.Last year, 28,526 people made the crossing, up from 8,404 in 2020.Tony Smith, former director general of UK Border Force, said it could be weeks before it became clear if the ""radical"" new scheme was feasible.He told BBC Breakfast the government was likely to face a legal challenge when people are put on aircraft bound for Rwanda.""But then I'm not sure what the answer is to stopping the boats… because if we don't do something, then more people are going to drown,"" he said, adding the UK was potentially facing its biggest asylum intake ever.In a speech on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the agreement with Rwanda would provide ""safe and legal routes for asylum"".""Economic migrants taking advantage of the asylum system will not get to stay in the UK, while those with genuine need will be properly protected,"" he said.He said the scheme would cover anyone who had arrived in the UK illegally since the start of this year.'Just another risk to factor in'By Jessica Parker, at a camp in Dunkirk, northern FranceNo one we initially spoke to yesterday seemed to know about the Rwanda announcement - but it wasn't long before word spread.Soon a group of men was asking us lots of questions: ""When will this happen? Why? If I come from Afghanistan will it still apply to me?""Shafi, who told me he fled Afghanistan, said: ""[Rwanda] is a lot worse place than Afghanistan, there is no future for us in Rwanda.""But I didn't meet anyone who said the government's plans would prevent them from trying to cross the Channel, including Shafi, who said he had no choice.Many of these men have already faced huge risks to get this far and are willing to risk their lives crossing the Channel on a small boat.The risk of being sent to Rwanda, at this stage, seemed like just another thing to factor in down the line.More than 160 charities and campaign groups have urged the government to scrap the plan, describing it in an open letter as ""shamefully cruel"".Refugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said it would do little to deter desperate people and ""only lead to more human suffering"".Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson was trying to distract the country from the Partygate scandal with an ""unworkable, unethical, and extortionate"" scheme. The Lib Dems said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees, while the SNP's Ian Blackford called the plan ""absolutely chilling"".Former Ukip and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said it was ""not much more than a short-term solution"".Questions are also being raised about the price of the scheme, with The Times reporting a cost of £20,000 to £30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda.But justice and migration minister Tom Pursglove declined to give such a figure, telling BBC Breakfast it would depend on several factors.He said the UK was spending nearly £5m a day on hotels, while the new scheme would initially cost £120m, with more money to be given later.A similar programme in Australia cost an estimated £460m in 2021 but successfully resettled only 239 people - a cost of around £1.9m per person. Concerns are being raised about the human rights record of Rwanda and its president, Paul Kagame.Mr Pursglove said Rwanda was a progressive country which wanted to provide sanctuary and had made ""huge strides forward"" in the last three decades.The minister said it was now one of only two countries in the world with a female-majority parliament and had an antidiscrimination law running ""right through its constitution"".However, just last year the UK government expressed concern at the United Nations about Rwanda's ""continued restrictions to civil and political rights and media freedom"".Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International UK, said sending people to the east-African nation was ""the very height of irresponsibility"".Yolande Makolo, a spokesperson for Rwanda's government, told the BBC it is a ""safe country, it's developing rapidly, we care as much as every country about human rights"".According to an agreement between the two governments, people sent to Rwanda will get accommodation and support. They will be free to come and go from their accommodation at all times.A WORLD WITHOUT DWARFISM?: Ellie Simmonds investigates a controversial new drugEGG ROLLING, WITCHES AND FREE MONEY: How many questions on Easter traditions can you get right?Land of safety - or fear?

Voters living in every district across Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire can have their say on 4 May.The last time local elections took place on this scale was in 2019, when the country was led by Theresa May and the UK was still part of the European Union.Three Prime Ministers later and Rishi Sunak is about to face his first big test at the ballot box. ReutersEconomic concerns loom in ScunthorpeWhile council elections are supposed to be about who empties our bins and repairs our roads, they are inevitably seen as a reflection on decisions made at Westminster.The Conservatives are currently the dominant party of local government in Lincolnshire.Labour will defend just one council in the county, the City of Lincoln.But the party led by Sir Keir Starmer is confident of making gains and is targeting North Lincolnshire, which has been Tory controlled since 2011.The Scunthorpe-based authority has regularly swung between the Conservatives and Labour since its creation in 1996.North Lincolnshire could be seen as a test of 'red wall' voters - people who traditionally voted Labour but who switched sides to propel Boris Johnson to election victory.Here, economic concerns loom large following the recent announcement of job losses at Scunthorpe steelworks.PA MediaUp to 2,000 asylum seekers could live at the site in Lincolnshire, the government saidMany eyes will be on West Lindsey, the district which is home to RAF Scampton.The former Red Arrows base and home of the World War Two Dambusters has been earmarked to house 2,000 asylum seekers by the Home Office.A number of local Conservatives have spoken out against the plan and the issue could decide whether the Tories remain in control here, with the Liberal Democrats currently the second largest party.What photo ID do you need to vote?Is there an election in my area?When are elections and who can vote?What can't I do in a polling station?What to expect from May's electionNorth of the Humber, the Lib Dems will defend their slender majority on Hull City Council which was secured last year following a decade of Labour dominance.Only one third of seats are up for grabs in Hull, but political control of the city could be decided by a handful of voters in a couple of swing wards.

""We believe if people make a contribution to this country, if they live here, there's an argument for having them involved in [the democratic] process.""The Conservative Party said Labour's plan to give foreign nationals the vote at parliamentary elections ""is laying the groundwork to drag the UK back into the EU by stealth"".""The right to vote in parliamentary elections and choose the next UK government is rightly restricted to British citizens and those with the closest historical links to our country,"" Conservative Party Chairman Greg Hands said.Starmer refuses to rule out coalition with Lib DemsFocus on living costs, Starmer tells new councilsMinisters to ditch deadline to scrap retained EU lawsCurrently, EU nationals who are legally resident in the UK can vote in local and devolved elections but not general elections.A Labour source said the party was thinking about proposals ""that will enable people who live and contribute long-term to our society to be able to have their say in how the country is governed"".The source said Sir Keir believes it is ""fair and right"" to give those people a voice in elections.But the source said the details of the proposals have not yet been decided, despite suggestions made in newspaper reports by the Financial Times and the Sunday Telegraph.There are an estimated 3.4 million EU nationals with settled status in the UK, and a further 2.7m with pre-settled status.Settled status allows EU citizen to continue to live, work and study in the UK on an indefinite basis, while pre-settled status is a grant of temporary residence for five years.The idea of extending the franchise to more EU nationals in the UK is controversial, with the Conservatives branding such a move ""an attempt to rig the electorate to re-join the EU"".When Sir Keir was running to be Labour leader in 2020, he said the ""government should give all three million EU nationals living in the UK full voting rights in future elections"".""We were never just 'tolerating' EU citizens living in this country - they are our neighbours, friends and families,"" Sir Keir wrote in an op-ed for the Guardian. ""To see their status in doubt devastates our sense not just of justice but also of fellowship.""Getty ImagesExtending the franchise to more EU nationals in the UK is a controversial ideaLabour's 2019 manifesto included a commitment to ""oversee the largest extension of the franchise in generations"" by lowering the voting age to 16 and giving ""full voting rights to all UK residents"".As the party looks ahead to the next general election, it is deciding what reforms on voting rights to propose in its manifesto.The BBC has been told Labour's package of proposals will include the introduction of votes for 16- and 17-year-olds, in line with Scotland and Wales.At the moment, 16 and 17-year-olds are allowed to vote in elections for the Scottish and Welsh devolved parliaments, but cannot vote in general elections.A commitment to lower the voting age to 16 was included in both Labour's 2015 and 2017 manifestos.The Greens and the Liberal Democrats also support lowering the voting age.Should all young people be able to vote at 16?Starmer refuses to rule out coalition with Lib DemsFocus on living costs, Starmer tells new councils'I stand by every word' says Starmer on attack adEU citizensLabour Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65590121"

Live updates: Russian forces reach KyivEurope prepares for wave of Ukrainian refugeesKuenssberg: Ministers braced for 'long and serious' conflictFear and confusion in frontline Ukrainian cityAir travel is no longer an option, as the Western airlines are completely avoiding the country's airspace, and Kyiv's international airport was reportedly one of the first targets of Russian strikes.Some people walked on foot, wheeling their possessions in suitcases across the border into Poland and Hungary.UN aid agencies said on Friday that fuel, cash and medical supplies are running low in parts of Ukraine, which could drive up to five million people to flee abroad.At least 100,000 people have already fled their homes, while several thousand have crossed into neighbouring countries including Moldova, Romania and Poland, UN refugee agency spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told a briefing in Geneva.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the humanitarian impact of the conflict ""threatens to be enormous"", but added the UK needed to do everything it could to stabilise Ukraine's economy and support its government.In their letter, the charities - which also include the International Rescue Committee UK, the Refugee Council, and dozens of other humanitarian groups - said the Ukraine attack could be ""the most significant European conflict since the collapse of Yugoslavia"".""A generation ago, the UK saved the lives of thousands of families from the Balkans through an evacuation and resettlement programme,"" they said.""The government should now respond with a well-resourced initiative working with councils across the country, to welcome Ukrainians who need sanctuary.""Cllr James Jamieson, chairman of the LGA, said councils were ""deeply saddened by the tragic events unfolding in Ukraine"" and were following the situation closely.""As shown with the recent conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, councils have a proud history of welcoming refugees, stepping forward voluntarily to offer homes and support to new arrivals and helping resettle them in local communities,"" he said.Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner welcomed the prime minister's vow to help Ukrainian refugees saying: ""They are in need, and we should be responding to that need."" Speaking in Newcastle, she said: ""I'm incredibly proud of the Ukrainians and I'm proud of what our country is doing to support their freedom and their right to exist.The Liberal Democrats foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, described the queues of people ""desperate to get out before it is too late."" She said LGBTQ+ people, journalists and activists feared persecution from Russian forces.""We must not turn our backs on the people of Ukraine in their hour of need,"" she said.ReutersSmall crowds gathered at the Ukrainian border as people fleeing waited to be let into PolandThe charities also urged the government to rethink its Nationality and Borders Bill, which they said would make it harder for refugees like those from Ukraine to claim asylum in the UK.The bill would make it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introduce life sentences for those who facilitate illegal entry into the country, potentially penalising those seeking sanctuary.Visa applications from Ukraine for people who are not related to British nationals are currently suspended, meaning there is no legal route for them to enter the UK and claim asylum.A source told the BBC the government is ""scenario planning"" for an increase in asylum seekers from Ukraine.Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from on the groundTHE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine?FROM KYIV: BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any moreFROM MOSCOW: Shock and support in Russian capitalIN MAPS: How Russia carried out the invasionThe Home Office said on Thursday night it was allowing some Ukrainian nationals in the UK to extend their visas.Those on visitor visas will be able to switch to apply for family visas or the points-based immigration system without leaving the country, potentially allowing them to get a job and stay in the UK for longer.Ukrainians in the UK already on the point-based system will be able to stay longer and seasonal agricultural workers will have their visas automatically extended until the end of the year.JUST HOW 'PUNK' IS BREWDOG?

"7 March 2023","Small boats: Sunak to outline plan to stop migrant crossings","Small boats: Sunak to outline plan to stop migrant crossings7 March 2023ShareMichael Sheils McNamee & Dominic CascianiBBC NewsSharePA MediaA new law set to go before Parliament later will introduce new measures aimed at removing migrants entering the UK on small boats.  The Illegal Migration Bill is set to prevent those arriving illegally from claiming asylum, and will block them from returning or seeking citizenship. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was ""fair for those at home and those who have a legitimate claim to asylum"".Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has described the plans as ""unworkable"".Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the bill would push ""the boundaries of international law"" without breaking it - telling the Express the measures were needed to ""solve this crisis"".The government believes the issue of migrant crossings matters to voters and will be key at the next election, and ministers are prepared to test legal limits to address it.The PM has made tackling it one of the central pledges of his premiership.There are also clear political messages being raised, with Ms Braverman accusing Labour of ""betraying hard working Brits"" by not backing the plans.More than 45,000 people entered the UK via Channel crossings last year, up from around 300 in 2018.Plan for Channel migrants ban unworkable - charityHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?Under the proposals, the home secretary would be placed under a ""duty to remove"" those arriving illegally in the UK. This would take precedence in law over someone's right to claim asylum - although there would be exemptions for the under-18s and those with serious medical conditions. While the bill would not become law for several months it would apply retrospectively, meaning anyone arriving in the UK illegally from Tuesday would be at risk of deportation. The new laws are expected to strain the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN's Refugee Convention - which currently give rights to asylum seekers arriving in the UK.Reports suggest the legislation will come with an unusual legal warning.Every new bill must include an assurance to MPs that it complies with the Human Rights Act, but it is reported Tuesday's package may instead come with a ""Section 19b"" statement.This is a formal alert to MPs that the proposals may be incompatible with human rights and therefore could fail before the courts.There have only ever been a handful of these warnings - and they are only added when the government's top internal lawyers have warned ministers that an idea could be legally unworkable.The government is expected to face a number of serious practical obstacles in making any of the proposed measures a reality. While it has a majority in the Commons, parts of the plan could be blocked in the Lords.And if it becomes law, there will be a slew of challenges to judges.Under the new measures, the home secretary would have to detain and remove those arriving illegally to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country ""as soon as reasonably practicable"" - no matter where they come from. The government already has a policy in place aimed at deporting some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but so far no one has been sent there and any plans to do so are currently being held up by legal challenges. What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?In December the High Court ruled the policy was legal, and did not breach the UN's Refugee Convention.A refugee is a person who has been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster, where as a migrant refers more broadly to anyone who moves from one place to another. The Times reports two former RAF bases in Lincolnshire and Essex would be used to house those detained before their removal.Meanwhile, the Immigration Services Union representing border staff called the plans ""quite confusing"", as they did not seem possible without the Rwanda policy functioning.The union's Lucy Moreton also suggested on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that smuggling gangs would tell people ""quick, cross now before anything changes"", risking an increase in the number of crossings.'Enough is enough'In an opinion piece for the Sun, Mr Sunak said the UK had a ""proud history of welcoming those most in need"" and the new measures were ""fair for those at home and those who have a legitimate claim to asylum"".""Those arriving on small boats aren't directly fleeing a war-torn country or facing an imminent threat to life,"" he said.""Instead, they have travelled through safe, European countries before crossing the Channel. The fact that they can do so is unfair on those who come here legally and enough is enough.""Ms Braverman said she and the prime minister had been ""working tirelessly"" to make sure the bill worked and it was about ""fairness"" for the ""tens of thousands of migrants"" who were ""not jumping the queue"".The prime minister will meet France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday to discuss further cooperation that will be required to reduce boat crossings. Ministers expect this bill to cause a row.It is perhaps the first row they have consciously picked since Rishi Sunak became prime minister, rather than walked into by accident.It is, remember, one of the PM's five key promises. Three relate to the economy, one to the NHS and the final one is to ""stop the boats"".Quite the challenge.It is the ""last chance for the Conservatives to sort this,"" one insider acknowledges - and Tory MPs say it really matters to plenty of the voters they want to keep onside.You can read Chris' full analysis hereLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the only way to deal with the issue of crossings was ""to break the criminal gangs who are driving this"". He called for more resources to set up a specialist unit within the National Crime Agency and speedier processing of existing asylum applications. Numerous critics have also argued that, aside from schemes for people from specific countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, there are currently no safe and legal routes for most people to seek asylum in the UK. The Liberal Democrats called the measures ""immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers while doing nothing to stop small boat crossings"".The Refugee Council said it would ""shatter the UK's long-standing commitment under the UN Convention to give people a fair hearing regardless of the path they have taken to reach our shores"".And Freedom from Torture, a charity which provides therapy to asylum seekers, described the measures as ""vindictive and dysfunctional"".Can PM deliver progress on boats?What does the PM's promise to stop the boats mean?Dozens of child migrants still missing from seaside citySuella BravermanRefugees and asylum seekersRishi Sunak","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64871193"

An ally later suggested he had been posing a rhetorical question.  The government's Rwanda bill became law on Thursday, and says any asylum seeker entering the UK ""illegally"" after 1 January 2022 from a safe country, could be sent on a one-way flight to Rwanda.The audience member pointed out that there had been recent conflict between Congo and neighbouring Rwanda and a long history of violence.He asked: ""Had my family members come from Goma (a city on the DR Congo's border with Rwanda) on a crossing right now, would they then be sent back to the country they are supposedly warring - Rwanda?""Does that make any sense to you?""Mr Philp replied: ""No, I think there's an exclusion on people from Rwanda being sent to Rwanda.""After the audience member objected that his parents were ""not from Rwanda"", the minister said: ""Well, I mean, Rwanda is a different country to Congo isn't it?""It's a different country?""The comment caused a short outburst of laughter from some members of the debate programme's audience as Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting's eyes darted around the room.Mr Philp continued: ""There is a clause in the legislation that says if somebody would suffer, I think the phrase is 'serious and irreversible harm' by being sent somewhere, they wouldn't be sent.""So there is that safety mechanism built into the legislation.""Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the government was sending £576m to a country they ""couldn't even pick out on a map"". The Liberal Democrats' Sarah Olney said it showed this was ""not a serious government"". An ally of Mr Philp suggested the minister had been asking a rhetorical question, rather than a real one, as he tried to clarify what he had been asked.The Home Office has said there will be a case-by-case risk assessment when determining people's suitability for relocation.In 2022 Rwanda's minister for foreign affairs Vincent Biruta said the government would prefer not to receive people from neighbouring countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Uganda or Tanzania.

The collective heart rate of Westminster is notching up.The summit - a general election - is in sight, even if the time it'll take to reach it is still guesswork.There has to be an election by the end of January 2025 at the absolute latest.""I think it's going to be May!"" one former cabinet minister confided to me, suggesting the broad Westminster consensus that the election is most likely to be in autumn 2024 might be wrong.In truth, the precise timing will be decided by the prime minister and a tiny group of people around him; his best man turned political secretary James Forsyth, his chief of staff Liam Booth Smith and election strategist Issac Levido perhaps among a very limited few.And they have no reason to have decided for certain yet anyway.Stuff that is yet to happen could still play a big part in when polling day actually is.Will PM's changes to net zero policies save us money? PM considers radical shake-up of A-levelsLib Dems to launch conference with free care planSunak scraps home energy efficiency taskforce But the gradient is steepening, the air is increasingly rarefied.You can smell it, feel it, see it around Westminster.'Flashing lights wherever you look'And the same will be true at the party conferences, starting with the gathering of Liberal Democrats in Bournemouth this weekend.Rishi Sunak's shift on green policies - revealed first by the BBC - felt like a beacon marking out this change.1:48The PM says ""we have to change how we do politics"" as he speaks about climate change and its impact on families.Conservative campaign headquarters had been primed in advance and had their social media messaging ready to go, even if the leak to the BBC played havoc with their plans for 24 hours.But there are other flashing lights wherever you look. Not only was the man who is miles ahead in the polls glad-handing the president of France.But when Sky News pointed out that Labour leader Keir Starmer had said ""we don't want to diverge"" from the European Union if he becomes prime minister, cabinet minister Michael Gove was out in front of a camera having a pop at him within an hour or so.Where a secretary of state instantly pounced on arguably rather loose language from Sir Keir, other cabinet ministers quickly followed suit.The speed of the reaction was another illustration of campaign machines cranking up a gear.On this week's show are defence secretary Grant Shapps, Lib Dem leader Ed Davey and Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, Darren Jones Watch live on BBC One and iPlayer from 09:00 BST on SundayFollow latest updates in text and video on the BBC News website from 08:00 BST So what happens next?Three sentences from Rishi Sunak the other day sketch out a map for him for the months ahead.He said: ""The real choice confronting us is do we really want to change our country and build a better future for our children, or do we want to carry on as we are? I have made my decision: we are going to change. And over the coming months, I will set out a series of long-term decisions to deliver that change.""The context is this: the prime minister has steadied things, the government isn't about to collapse, but the Conservative party is in a massive hole in the opinion polls, and so is Mr Sunak himself.A new poll for YouGov suggests he is personally more unpopular than at any time since he became prime minister.And No10 has concluded it is time to be more aggressive. As I wrote a few weeks ago, that has involved beefing up the team at the top.'Education shake-up'So what could we hear from them this autumn?An education shake-up in England is being considered. One idea is A-levels are scrapped and replaced with a baccalaureate in which English and maths become compulsory elements of post-16 education.What about transport? Ministers are studiously ducking questions on whether HS2, the high-speed rail line between Manchester and London, is actually going to be built in full.One idea being discussed privately in government, I hear, is that the new line joins the existing West Coast Mainline at Handsacre in Staffordshire, 20 miles north of Birmingham.In this scenario, trains to and from Manchester, for instance, could use the HS2 line but be on the existing line from the West Midlands to the north west of England.That would amount to a significant junking of a big chunk of the planned project.Johnson warns against 'mutilated' version of HS2Labour pledges watchdog power after Truss mini-budgetLib Dem leader rejects election deals with LabourAnother option would be for the government to push back the time frame for delivering the northern leg of HS2.Both could free up money for east-west rail improvements in the north of England and, depending on the option chosen, probably leave money to spare.Next, the European Convention on Human Rights.Some senior Conservatives, including cabinet ministers, want the Tories to advocate leaving the convention if the plan to send migrants to Rwanda is rejected next month by the Supreme Court.""Nothing is off the table,"" immigration minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC this week.There is frustration at the role of the European Court of Human Rights in stopping flights for asylum seekers taking off last year.But even those keen on withdrawal acknowledge privately ""it'd be like Brexit 2.0"" - complicated and controversial.Labour 'hesitant'Where does all of this leave Labour?Laurent BLEVENNECSir Keir Starmer met French President Emmanuel Macron in France this weekIt leaves them forced to take a position. And so determined are they to project a sense of being economically credible, when the Conservatives advocate or imply a policy shift, the Opposition has been hesitant to instantly reject it.Take HS2, where shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is very cautious - and so, like government ministers, won't unequivocally back the full project, as you can hear on the BBC's Newscast.Why? Labour argue if they inherit projects in a mess, that will inform what they can do.But they also don't want big gaps opening up between their spending promises and those of the Tories, when the public finances are so squeezed. As for Labour's own policy ideas, they have to work out a timeframe for unveiling them without knowing when the election will happen. And that isn't easy. But neither, for the moment, is Rishi Sunak's situation.The Conservatives' great knack - over the last 13 years in government but also, arguably, over the last century and more - has been a shapeshifting sensibility to mould to the moment.It can and has proven very successful, but there is evidence too that there are diminishing returns to reinvention.Writing for Conservative Home, James Frayne argues the change in green policies might only register for many as something the Tories have changed their mind on.Some of the challenges for the fifth prime minister of a party's long run in power are simply inescapable.Will Sunak's green rethink transform Tory fortunes?Job cuts and rising debt means things will get worseEnergy bill help urged to stave off winter crisisConservative Party","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66900221"

George Galloway of the Workers Party for Britain said he wanted to save Rochdale AFC and reopen the market.A number of the 11 candidates standing in the by-election had been due to take part in the debate.It had to be cancelled after two of the candidates withdrew in the last 24 hours. The Labour candidate Azhar Ali, who has been suspended by the party, said he could not participate due to family reasons, before the Liberal Democrats' Iain Donaldson also pulled out. Guy Otten of the Green Party and Conservative Paul Ellison had already said they were unavailable, which left only Mr Danczuk and Mr Galloway able to participate. All 11 candidates have provided the BBC with minute manifestos ahead of the vote on 29 February.Simon Danczuk said his ""only priority"" was RochdaleMr Danczuk told BBC North West that while others talked about the conflict in Gaza, ""I'm talking about Rochdale"". He said the town's Labour council had ""failed to protect the victims in the grooming scandal"" and there were also issues with burglaries.""There's a real issue about protection and Greater Manchester Police needed to step up to the mark,"" he said.Mr Danczuk, who was previously the town's Labour MP before he resigned from the party following his suspension, said people in Rochdale were ""disillusioned"" with politics.""The truth is the people in Rochdale feel let down by the mainstream parties,"" he said.He said the Conservatives had ""let people down in terms of the economy, because that has stagnated nationally and that has an impact on Rochdale"" and had ""let the country down in terms of illegal immigration"", which had left the town taking ""a disproportionate number of asylum seekers over the years"", causing ""local tensions"".He said Labour had also ""really let the town down, because they run the local council"" and they had ""not protected young people in terms of the grooming scandal"", while also failing to ""stimulate the local economy"".""I'm there, talking with Reform UK, for a radical change in British politics and representing Rochdale,"" he added.Mr Galloway said he was working to save Rochdale AFC and resurrect its covered marketMr Galloway, who leads his party, said he wanted to ""make Rochdale great again"". He said he was working to save Rochdale AFC, which was ""heading for liquidation"", and get it back into the Football League, as without it, the town was ""literally without a heart"". ""I'm calling on the council to step in immediately to stop it hitting the wall,"" he said.The former Labour and Respect Party MP said he was working on a plan that will allow the council to buy the ground, which would allow a consortium to be formed that could buy the ground back. ""They've got the collateral of the stadium, which is worth far more than is needed right now to staunch the flow, so the council's risking nothing and they'll get their money back,"" he said.He said he was also wanted to reopen the covered market at the Exchange Shopping Centre and bring clothing giant Primark to the town.""The one thing that unites everybody in Rochdale of all political stripes is that the town hall needs change,"" he said.""Rochdale should be a very prosperous place, it once was and we need to get that back.""He said poverty was ""a real thing"" in the town, despite it being ""20 minutes from this great metropolis of Manchester"", which made it ""quite hard to see how the political leaders have let it get to the stage"".Mr Galloway, who previously stated that the main focus of his campaign would be calling for a resolution to the conflict in Gaza, said that was ""only one of many"" issues.""The job of an MP is local, national and international and I think I'm the best candidate for that,"" he added.""I'll be fighting for every vote in every street every part of the constituency right up until the last hour, the last minute.""Coverage of the by-election on 29 February, which was called following the death of Sir Tony Lloyd in January, will continue across the BBC.Why not follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

"9 December 2023","Emergency Rwanda legislation is doomed to fail, says Robert Jenrick","Emergency Rwanda legislation is doomed to fail, says Robert Jenrick9 December 2023ShareJacqueline HowardBBC NewsShareGetty ImagesThe article marks Mr Jenrick's first public comment since his resignationFormer immigration minister Robert Jenrick has said the government's latest proposal to ensure it can send asylum seekers to Rwanda will fail to end the ""merry-go-round"" of the scheme getting caught up in legal issues.Mr Jenrick aired his views in a Daily Telegraph editorial, his first public comment since resigning. He resigned on Wednesday over his lack of faith in the legislation.The government will hold a vote on the proposed legislation on Tuesday.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on MPs to support it, arguing that the new bill is the ""only approach"" that would successfully prevent further legal challenges stopping flights carrying asylum seekers taking off to Rwanda.But while some MPs think the legislation is too tough, others share Mr Jenrick's view that it does not go far enough.In his opinion piece, the former immigration minister said the test of the Rwanda legislation was whether it could ""end the merry-go-round of legal challenges"" that prevented the removal of asylum seekers who have entered the UK illegally after crossing the English Channel in small boats.""Having done as much as I could to strengthen the legislation, I concluded, regrettably, the answer is no,"" he wrote, adding the issue forced his resignation.The government has always seen the policy as a key tactic to provide a deterrent to the many thousands of people who attempt to make the perilous journey. In the first nine months of 2023, a total of 24,830 have arrived in this way, after 45,774 did so in the whole of 2022.Mr Jenrick said it was his view that border control would be ""far more straightforward if we [the UK] extricated ourselves from the web of international frameworks that have taken on near mythical status within government"".""One of the advantages of our uncodified constitution is the unfettered power of our sovereign parliament to create law,"" he added.He claimed those who opposed the Rwanda plan, and a tough cut in net migration in general, held ""flawed assumptions about the cultural benefits of mass immigration"".Politicians on the right have a choice looming, Mr Jenrick said:, adding ""Begin to deliver on the mainstream concerns of ordinary people when it comes to immigration, or face their red-hot fury at the ballot box"".PA MediaRishi Sunak made stopping the arrival of small boats carrying asylum seekers one of his five key pledges to the publicFollowing Mr Jenrick's resignation last week, Mr Sunak called a news conference to state his confidence in the bill.He insisted the legislation was the ""toughest immigration law ever"", that only allowed for individual legal challenges if the small boat arrival can prove ""with credible and compelling evidence"" they have a ""real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm"".""Going any further would mean that Rwanda would collapse the scheme and then we'll have nowhere to send anyone to - and that is not the way to get this going,"" Mr Sunak added.In his editorial, Mr Jenrick said that allowing such challenges invites asylum seekers to ""concoct a reason to delay their removal"".""The small-boat-chasing law firms will gladly assist them in this endeavour,"" he wrote.Mr Jenrick, and those who share his views, want the bill to prevent the possibility of such legal challenges under domestic and international human rights laws.The bill that will be put to parliament this week compels judges to treat Rwanda as a safe country and gives ministers the powers to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act.It follows the signing of a treaty between the UK and Rwanda that the British government says ensures that people relocated to Rwanda are not at risk of being returned to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.The Liberal Democrats have called for Mr Sunak to be investigated over a £100m payment to Rwanda, which the party argues breaches the ministerial code. because it was not publicly declared for eight months.""The public deserves transparency, not hushed-up backroom dealings. We need an urgent inquiry to get to the bottom of this,"" MP Christine Jardine said.The Rwanda scheme - which was first announced by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in April 2022 - has been repeatedly delayed by legal challenges and was found to be illegal by the UK Supreme Court in November.Labour has also pledged to scrap the policy if it wins the next election and pursue a policy of greater border security.In his editorial, Mr Jenrick described the Labour policy as a ""laughable"" way to address ""one of the great challenges of the 21st Century"".How the UK's asylum deal is viewed in RwandaTory MPs under pressure to back Sunak Rwanda planWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Robert JenrickUK immigrationImmigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67669609"

Mr Galloway is mainly targeting Rochdale's Muslim population, who make up about 30% of the electorate, many of whom are angry about what is happening in Gaza.""The people of Gaza don't have a vote in this election, you do,"" reads one of his campaign leaflets.At a meeting at the town's Kashmir Youth Project, he says that, if elected, he will ""enter the chamber of the House of Commons like a tornado"" and ""shake the walls for Gaza"".He claims a victory for him in Rochdale, a small town near Manchester, will be noticed ""by the people in Gaza, by the people in Tel Aviv, but most importantly by the front benches in Parliament.""    All the candidates in the Rochdale by-electionBy-election candidates discuss Rochdale's needsParliamentary chaos reflects Rochdale campaigningLabour's candidate Azhar Ali, who had backed an immediate ceasefire in Gaza before Keir Starmer's calls this week for an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"", was disowned by the party when a recording of him making allegedly antisemitic comments emerged, for which he apologised.Labour members in the town were ordered to stop campaigning for him - and the shutters came down on the party's campaign headquarters. But Mr Ali is still officially Labour's candidate - that's how he will appear on the ballot paper this coming Thursday because it was legally too late to change. If he is elected, he will sit in the Commons as an independent MP.But it was clear from speaking to voters in the rain-lashed town centre on Tuesday evening that some Labour supporters were either not aware of him being dropped by the party or did not care.Paul Walsh, a 56-year-old roofer, said he knew all about the controversy but he was still going to vote Labour anyway.Rumours had been swirling that Mr Ali's supporters were still campaigning for him - although there was little evidence of this beyond some mocked up social media images depicting Keir Starmer as a clown.On Thursday, Mr Ali broke cover to say that these images had nothing to do with him.In a statement, he said that he had been ""a Labour supporter for more than 30 years and has Labour values"". He added that he was campaigning and standing to be Rochdale's MP and that Sir Tony was a friend and he ""wants to continue his good work"".Little wonder some voters seem confused about who to back.Wendy Fleming, who recently moved to Rochdale from Ireland, half-jokingly suggests that the Monster Raving Loony Party candidate Ravin Rodent Subortna seems to be the only one talking sense.""That actually hurts my soul,"" she says. ""Voting is something I really do take seriously, always have done, but this time it's so difficult. It's really just going to be the best of a bad bunch.""Tom Pilston/BBCWendy Fleming says she is struggling to find any candidate worth backingJust about everyone you speak to is fed up with the bad press Rochdale has received in recent years.The town, in the foothills of the Pennines, has a proud history - it was the birthplace of the Cooperative movement and 1930s film legend Gracie Fields.But it has recently become associated with child sexual exploitation and grooming - something that is an issue at the ballot box, with William Howarth standing as the Parents Against Grooming UK candidate.The town centre has had a makeover, with a new shopping centre, and its Grade I listed town hall has just benefited from a £20m restoration. But social deprivation' , poor housing and crime are rife.George Galloway is eager not to be seen as a single-issue campaigner and is promising to ""make Rochdale great again"". He is calling for the local hospital's maternity ward to be re-opened - and has even promised to help save the local football club, Rochdale AFC, which is facing bankruptcy after being relegated from the Football League.Many young Muslim voters in the town have been energised by his campaign - both for its focus on Gaza and his promise to tackle the town's social ills.Area Shakeel, who is studying to be a mental health nurse and volunteers at a local soup kitchen, says: ""He's actually listened to our views and our opinions in a diverse community - you feel like you are being heard when you are speaking to him.""Tom Pilston/BBCMs Shakeel believes George Galloway listens to the communityBut the man who sees himself as Mr Galloway's main rival, the town's former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, accuses him of ignoring the majority of voters in the town, who, he says, are ""white, working people"".Mr Danczuk, who was suspended by the Labour Party in 2015 for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl, something he now dismisses as ""tabloid nonsense"", is standing for Reform UK.  He insists his ""old Labour values"" are perfectly in tune with Reform - normally seen as being to the right of the Tory Party. He says he voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but ""only just"" so has no problem with being the candidate for the former Brexit Party. He says his focus is ""100% on Rochdale"", tackling crime and taking a hard line on immigration.  ""What we have seen over time is places like Rochdale, a proud Lancashire town, its culture and ethos diluted by ridiculous amounts of asylum seekers being placed here,"" he says.Tom Pilston/BBCReform UK candidate Simon Danczuk is Rochdale's former Labour MPTom Pilston/BBCGeorge Galloway is mainly targeting Rochdale's Muslim populationMr Danczuk says he and Mr Galloway, both former Labour MPs, have shared platforms in the past. But those days are long gone. ""He's a chancer, a grifter,"" says Mr Danczuk, who highlights the former Respect MP's record of standing for election - in some cases with great success - in areas with large Muslim populations. ""He's gone from Bradford to Tower Hamlets, now he's showing up in Rochdale. He should take his daft hat, his fat cigars and his extremist policies back to wherever he comes from.""Mr Galloway initially says he won't dignify this with a response, but can't resist a jibe of his own.""Being called a chancer by Simon Danczuk - it's a bit like being told to stand up straight by the Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" he says.After being expelled from Labour in 2003 over his stance on the Iraq war, he has defeated Labour in Bethnal Green, in east London, for the anti-war Respect Party and - in one of the biggest by-election upsets of recent times - in Bradford West, in 2012. He says he wants to use Rochdale as a launchpad for his Workers Party of Britain, which is trying to recruit 50 candidates to send a message to Keir Starmer at the general election.Andrew Johnson, a 62-year-old housing campaigner, says he is worried about ""sectarianism"" if Galloway is elected and is voting Reform because it ""would be inappropriate, I think, to vote someone who is more concerned about things that are going on thousands of miles away than streets away"".Tom Pilston/BBCAndrew Johnson plans to vote for Reform UKBut Samur Mushtaq, a local restaurant owner and community campaigner, says he has been alarmed by the ""inflammatory rhetoric"" from the Danczuk campaign.""Personally, I just want a local MP who is going to represent the community well,"" he says, adding that he is ""veering towards the Liberal Democrats"".Rochdale was a Lib Dem stronghold not so long ago and the party's candidate Iain Donaldson believes it can be again.He backs a ceasefire in Gaza and an eventual ""two-state solution"" in the Middle East but is focusing his campaign on tackling ""child poverty and poor quality housing"" in Rochdale, among other local issues.  The Conservatives also have a strong following in the constituency, particularly in the more affluent suburbs and villages. They came second at the 2019 general election, with 14,000 votes.The Tory candidate, Paul Ellison, who runs a landscaping firm, is also campaigning on ""bread and butter"" issues like crime and local businesses. He was on holiday when we were in Rochdale, but James Daly, MP for nearby Bury North, insisted the party was ""fighting for every vote"".Roy Smethurst, out walking his dog Sunny in the pouring rain in Littleborough, a village just outside Rochdale, says he will be voting Conservative.""I used to be proud to be a Rochdalian,"" he says, adding: ""It's just not the same town I was brought up in or it doesn't seem to be to me."" He is no fan of George Galloway and his focus on Gaza. ""We are not going to influence what happens in the Middle East. It's just not going to happen.""Tom Pilston/BBC NewsRoy Smethurst plans to vote for the ConservativesAnother twist, in an already tortuous by-election comes courtesy of the Green Party, which disowned its candidate Guy Otten over old social media posts about the Muslim faith and the conflict in Gaza. The Greens are now campaigning for independent candidate Mark Coleman, a retired vicar and Just Stop Oil activist who has previously been jailed for non-violent direct action. Mr Coleman says his message is going over well with voters but cheerfully admits that he faces a court appearance in London just before polling day over his latest conviction. He says he hopes to avoid a jail sentence this time, after pleading guilty, so he can make it back to Rochdale for the count on Thursday.It's enough to make your head spin.One thing that appears to unite everyone in Rochdale is a sense that the town has been neglected and let down by politicians. Among the 11 candidates standing in the by-election are two local businessmen, David Tully and Michael Howarth. Neither have any political experience but both say they feel compelled to make a stand. Aqub Nazir, who runs youth project Aspire2Inspire, says the rise of independent candidates - and the number of people getting involved in community projects across the town - is a positive sign that people are willing to work for change.""There is a massive demand now for someone locally to stand up who is actually going to care for Rochdale as a community,"" he says.""I don't like to say it, but it's one of the most deprived areas in the whole of the United Kingdom so who is actually going to be doing work on the ground in Rochdale?""

"10 July 2023","What's happening in Parliament this week?","What's happening in Parliament this week?10 July 2023ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentSharePA MediaThe fallout from the inquiry which found Boris Johnson knowingly misled MPs continues on Monday, when MPs will be asked to approve another report from the Privileges Committee, which names and attempts to shame a number of senior Conservatives for a ""co-ordinated campaign of interference,"" in their inquiry, including former Commons Leader Jacob Rees Mogg and former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries. The motion says that MPs should not impugn the integrity of the committee when conducting such an investigation. Because this is a matter of privilege, not standards, the motion is both debateable and amendable, and the Lib Dems are proposing an amendment seeking sanctions for the MPs who were named as seeking to interfere with the investigation into Boris Johnson. There's also an amendment from a group of backbench Conservatives led by former Home Secretary Priti Patel, which which seeks to water down the bit about impugning committee members and to remove the words ""notes with approval"" from the motion - a swipe at the Committee. More amendments may follow.Elsewhere, Parliament's glide path to its summer recess looks likely to encounter some turbulence. There will be intensive ping-pong between the two Houses as the Lords and Commons seek to finalise several bills, with some talk that the Illegal Migration Bill, much amended in the Lords, could run past the summer break and into Parliament's brief September sitting. Johnson allies interfered with Partygate probe - reportLords back Archbishop's plan for refugee strategyCommons Leader Penny Mordaunt has announced four slots to consider Lords messages about the bill, (including two on Wednesday 19th) but after 20 government defeats, there is much to resolve.And peers embark on another legislative marathon with the start of seven days of report stage on the sprawling Levelling Up Bill. This covers a vast range of issues - devolution of bus services, high street banks, local nature plans, ancient woodland and the planning system, and, in an unusual move, the government has added in a new set of amendments on childcare at this late stage (Nerd note: this required changing the long title of the Bill) which could require the addition of a further Report day. Monday 10 July Commons (14:30) Levelling Up Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following at 15:30.Main debate: MPs debate the follow-up report by the Privileges Committee, to its inquiry into whether Boris Johnson knowingly misled Parliament over the Downing Street lockdown parties saga. MPs will also polish off their consideration of the spectacularly uncontroversial Electronic Trade Documents Bill, and then turn to the Northern Ireland Budget (No2) Bill, the latest of a long series of measures required because of the suspension of devolved government in Stormont.

Tuesday 11 JulyCommons: (11:30) Health questions, then Labour's Rachel Maskell has a ten minute rule bill to create a statutory definition of workplace bullyingMain debate: Hot from the House of Lords, MPs debate Lords amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill. The normal form is flat rejection of amendments voted through against government resistance (some of the changes made will be government tidying up amendments) but watch out for Conservative backbench pressure on issues like modern slavery and detention of child migrants. Committees: Treasury (10:15) questions the mortgage lenders including Lloyds, Santander, Nationwide on the impact of rising rates on consumers house prices and the wider housing market.Health (10:00) looks at how the places people live encourage or discourage activities such as sport, exercise, leisure and active travel.

There could also be more ping-pong on Commons Reasons or amendments to one of the several bills bouncing between MPs and peers. Friday 14 JulyCommons: (not sitting) Lords: (10:00) The House will rattle through a long list of private members bills - new laws proposed by individual peers.  First there are Third Reading debates on a series of bills that have already cleared the Commons, and are set to become law: the Employment Relations (Flexible Working) Bill, and the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Bill; the Child Support (Enforcement) Bill. The Women, Peace and Security Bill, which deals with support for women in UK sponsored and supported conflict prevention, peace processes, mediation and diplomatic delegations, has a Third Reading, but there's unlikely to be time for it to go through the Commons. Then come Second Readings for some bills which are not so far through the system; the Firearms Bill which regulates rifle ranges, the Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill , the Veterans Advisory and Pensions Committees Bill and the Pensions (Extension of Automatic Enrolment) (No. 2) Bill, and Committee on the Worker Protection (Amendment of Equality Act 2010) Bill.Some of these bills could be vulnerable if opponents pass the smallest amendment, because any change would require them to be considered again in the Commons, and debating time is unlikely to be available. There's a pretty determined lobby against the Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, which seeks to ban the advertising in the UK of things like elephant rides, dolphinariums and close encounters with big cats.

"7 March 2023","Plan for lifetime ban for Channel migrants is unworkable, say charities","Plan for lifetime ban for Channel migrants is unworkable, say charities7 March 2023ShareCharley Adams & Dominic Casciani & Jacob EvansBBC NewsShareDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesGovernment plans to ban migrants from re-entering the UK if they cross the Channel in small boats are unworkable and will leave thousands of people in limbo, refugee groups have said.  Under new legislation, Channel migrants would be removed from the UK, banned from future re-entry and barred from applying for British citizenship. Supporters say the PM is ""getting a grip"" on illegal migration. The government is expected to outline the plans on Tuesday.The proposed measures will apply to anyone arriving on UK shores in a small boat - but there are few details on how they will be implemented, with previous efforts to tighten procedures - such as the Rwanda policy - mired in legal challenges. PM Rishi Sunak, who has made the issue one of his top priorities, told the Mail on Sunday: ""Make no mistake, if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay.""But the Refugee Council, one of a number of charities to criticise the plans, accused ministers of shattering the UK's long-standing commitment under the UN Convention to give people a fair hearing, regardless of how they get to the UK.The group's head Enver Solomon said the plans would ""add more cost and chaos to the system"", adding: ""It's unworkable, costly and won't stop the boats"".How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?It is thought the legislation would place a duty on the home secretary to remove all those arriving on boats to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country ""as soon as reasonably practicable"" - no matter where they had come from - and would also permanently ban them from returning.Currently, asylum seekers arriving in the UK have the right to seek protection under the UN's Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights. But the Mail on Sunday says a clause in the Illegal Migration Bill is expected to apply a ""rights brake"" to effectively allow the conventions to be circumvented. It is not clear how this would work.The proposed legislation would also stop those coming to the UK in small boats from applying for British citizenship. Under current UK law, a person can seek to settle permanently and apply for citizenship after five years in the country - but this is not straightforward.Last year's immigration act already gave the home secretary the power to bar Channel migrants from seeking to resettle. It is possible the new plans might be aiming to make this an automatic ban and not a discretionary one.  Downing Street said the government would eventually open up more safe routes for asylum claims, but only ""once we have control over our borders"". While declining to give a timeline, Mr Sunak's official spokesman said rising numbers of Channel crossings meant ""there is no time to waste"" on implementing the new plans. But Labour's Wes Streeting called the measures ""the latest in a long line for unworkable gimmicks"" and predicted they would not ""see the light of day"" or get through Parliament. The shadow health secretary said the government should instead create better safe routes into the country, speed up the processing of asylum claims and direct money into the National Crime Agency to arrest criminal gangs trafficking people. More than 100 people in three boats were brought to shore by Border Force and the RNLI in Dover on Monday.Legal challengesDespite a deal being reached last year, not one migrant has been sent to Rwanda yet and any plans to do so are currently on hold after the policy was met with fierce opposition and legal interventions. In December, the High Court ruled the scheme did not breach the UN's Refugee Convention. But that decision is facing further challenges in the courts, with a preliminary hearing expected on Monday at the Court of Appeal.There is no agreement in place on the return of migrants with the EU. The home secretary - who will introduce the new laws - told the Sun on Sunday ""the only route to the UK will be a safe and legal route"".The Home Office says there are a number of these routes to the UK. However, some are only available to people from specific countries, such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, or for British National status holders in Hong Kong.Other asylum routes accept a limited number of refugees according to precise criteria.Meanwhile, figures obtained by the BBC show that Home Office charter flights to forcibly remove illegal immigrants from the UK cost more per seat than a first class ticket to New York. The government spent £12.7m last year on the flights - removing 1,500 people - a Freedom of Information request by BBC News has revealed. A quarter of the flights took off with 20 or fewer passengers on board, including two flights with less than 10.Of the 62 flights chartered by the Home Office in 2022, the data shows the flights worked out at an average of £205,000. What are the current rules for claiming UK asylum?  By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality CheckIt is already illegal for migrants to knowingly enter the UK without a visa or special permission.The rule, part of last year's Nationality and Borders Act, means people who illegally arrive in the UK can be jailed for up to four years and removed to a safe country. However, very small numbers are likely to be prosecuted.That's because the UK has an international legal obligation not to criminally penalise anyone who seeks protection as a refugee. The government says ""safe and legal"" routes for those seeking UK asylum already exist. However, most are only available to people from specific countries - like Afghanistan and Ukraine. WATCH: MP questions Braverman on safe routes to UKElsewhere, others have criticised the new plans with the Lib Dems calling them ""immoral, ineffective and incredibly costly for taxpayers while doing nothing to stop small boat crossings"".Freedom from Torture, a charity which provides therapy to asylum seekers, described the measures as ""vindictive and dysfunctional"".And Amnesty International called them ""disgraceful posturing and scaremongering"".The government has previously said the Rwanda plan would discourage others from crossing the English Channel but so far there is no evidence that has happened.In 2022, 45,756 migrants crossed the English Channel to Britain in small boats, according to government figures collated by the BBC.That is the highest number since the first records in 2018.Latest Home Office figures show 2,953 migrants have crossed the Channel using this method already this year, originating from a range of countries including Albania, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria.How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?How many people cross the Channel in small boats?What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Rwanda asylum flight cancelled after legal actionUK immigrationSuella BravermanRefugees and asylum seekersRishi SunakEurope migrant crisisMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64848101"

"26 October 2022","Rishi Sunak defends return of Suella Braverman to Home Office","Rishi Sunak defends return of Suella Braverman to Home Office26 October 2022ShareKate WhannelPolitical reporter, BBC NewsShareEPARishi Sunak has defended re-appointing Suella Braverman as home secretary days after she quit over data breaches.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new PM of doing a ""grubby deal"" with Ms Braverman to secure her support in the recent Tory leadership contest.He also asked if officials had raised concern over the appointment.Mr Sunak avoided the question but argued bringing Ms Braverman back into cabinet brought ""experience and stability"" to government.A No 10 spokesperson later denied reports that Simon Case - the head of the civil service - had been ""livid"" about the appointment. Suella Braverman back as home secretaryBraverman quitting and vote chaos add to Truss turmoilSuella Braverman's resignation letter in fullWho is in Rishi Sunak's cabinet?Taking his first Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak justified his decision telling MPs: ""The home secretary made an error of judgment but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake.""1:36Starmer welcomes Sunak as the first British Asian prime minister, calling it a “significant moment""He hit back at the Labour leader, accusing the party of being ""soft on crime and in favour of unlimited immigration"".Sir Keir pointed to his own experience as head of the Crown Prosecution Service adding: ""I know first hand how important it is that we have a home secretary whose integrity and professionalism are beyond question.""He's so weak, he's done a grubby deal trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election - there's a new Tory at the top but as always with them party first, country second.""The Liberal Democrats have also been critical of the appointment with the party's home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael saying: ""A home secretary who broke the rules is not fit for a Home Office which keeps the rules.""SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the prime minister of doing ""a sleazy backroom deal to shore up his own position"".Opposition parties are calling for investigations - the Liberal Democrats want an inquiry into Ms Braverman's appointment ""including any promises Sunak made to her behind closed doors"", while Labour wants one into possible security breaches by the home secretary.Some Conservative MPs have also privately expressed their concern to the BBC about the decision.During an urgent questions on the subject in Parliament, Labour MP Angela Eagle asked if an independent ethics adviser would investigate Ms Braverman's behaviour.Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin replied that Mr Sunak did intend to appoint a new adviser - the previous holder of the role quit earlier this year - but added that ""events in the last administration would not be properly part of the remit of the new independent adviser"".1:22The SNP's Ian Blackford says new PM Sunak did a ""sleazy backroom deal"" with Braverman to gain postMs Braverman stepped down last week amid the final days of Liz Truss's short-lived and chaotic premiership.In her resignation letter, she admitted committing a ""technical infringement"" of the rules by sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it. ""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,"" she wrote.Her letter also hinted at disagreements with Ms Truss over immigration policy expressing concern that the government was not delivering on commitments to tackle illegal migration. However, on his first day as prime minister Mr Sunak re-appointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.It came three days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential MP on the right-wing of the Conservative party. Asked if Ms Braverman had been given the job as a reward for supporting the new PM, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC Mr Sunak had strong support from MPs in the contest adding: ""I doubt he needed any particular individual endorsement.""What's behind Suella Braverman's comeback and what does it mean for policy?It's clear what she wants to do in the job - in her resignation letter to Liz Truss she said she had ""serious concerns"" over whether the government was committed to reducing overall migration numbers and stopping illegal immigration. At the Tory conference she talked about her ""dream"" of making the Rwanda policy work and wanting to eventually get immigration levels down to the tens of thousands. Remember Liz Truss was poised to make an announcement on immigration policy as a way of trying to stimulate economic growth - something over which she was reportedly at loggerheads with Suella Braverman.For Rishi Sunak, getting Suella Braverman's backing was a key moment in the truncated leadership campaign - and returning her to one of the great offices of states is an overture to the right of the party. He talked a lot about asylum seekers during the leadership contest over the summer - but less so about immigration, so we don't know much yet about his thinking. But it's interesting he's put one of his long-term allies - Robert Jenrick - in the Home Office as immigration minister.Perhaps his eyes and ears in the department, someone to make alternative arguments or shape one whole policy area. One to watch. The row over Ms Braverman's new job, came as MPs on the Home Affairs Committee heard evidence on Channel crossings. They had been due to hear from the immigration minister Tom Pursglove, but his appearance was cancelled after he lost his job in Tuesday's cabinet reshuffle. Instead MPs heard from Dan O'Mahoney - the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander - who told the committee that 38,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year in small boats - an increase compared to last year's figure of 28,526.The committee also heard that around 93% of people arriving in small boats this year have claimed asylum. However, there is a backlog in processing claims and only 4% of applications from 2021 have been processed. Mr O'Mahoney also noted there had been a huge increase in the number of Albanians arriving in the UK illegally - 21,000 in the UK this year, compared to 50 in 2020.

"29 April 2021","Scottish election 2021: NHS, independence and a 'Covid minister'","Scottish election 2021: NHS, independence and a 'Covid minister'29 April 2021ShareShareHere are five things you need to know about the Scottish Parliament election campaign today. We'll have more regular updates tomorrow.1. NHS, independence and refugeesPA MediaIssues highlighted by the main parties on Wednesday ranged from the economic impact of independence to refugee families being taken from their homes. Nicola Sturgeon said voting for the SNP would keep the NHS ""out of Boris Johnson's hands"", while Anas Sarwar said only a vote for Scottish Labour would help protect Scotland's vital services. The Scottish Conservatives argued the economic case for Scottish independence was ""weaker than ever"", and the Scottish Liberal Democrats proposed the next government should have a ""coronavirus recovery minister"". Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie condemned dawn raids in Glasgow where refugee families have been placed in detention centres.2. Former PM Blair enters independence debatePA MediaFormer prime minister Tony Blair told ITV news he doubted the people of Scotland wanted another independence referendum - even if the SNP wins a majority at next week's Holyrood election. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has argued a majority of pro-independence MSPs would provide a mandate for another referendum, with the SNP's prospects of winning an overall majority ""on a knife-edge"" according to polling guru Sir John Curtice. Former Labour leader Mr Blair, who was PM when the Scottish parliament was created in 1999, said he ""frankly doubts"" that people want to go through the ""disruption"" of another independence campaign, but that ""it becomes more difficult over time if opinion looks as if it's fixed"". You can read analysis on that interview from our political correspondent Andrew Kerr3. What issues are important to young voters? In recent years Scotland has seen a high level of political engagement among its citizens. Almost 19 out of 20 people felt it was important to vote in Holyrood elections in 2019, an increase of 15% since 2004 - and according to Scottish government data, that rise was partly driven by young people. Now with the pressures of the pandemic it perhaps comes as no surprise that party manifestos have been littered with policies designed to restore education, improve mental health and create job opportunities for people aged 16-24. So what issues matter to young voters? The BBC spoke to five people under the age of 30 to hear what might influence their vote.4. Scones, bookshops...and circus trainingGetty ImagesThe leaders of Scotland's five larger parties were asked which sort of business they would like to start in a life after politics, in a series of interviews conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross said he'd like to supply baked goods to the hospitality industry. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar would be keen to establish an international political campaign group. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she'd like to set up a bookshop. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie would open a corner shop or environmental charity. Scottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said she already had a plan to set up an aerial training venue for circus arts.5.

It has been criticised with some pointing out that last year the UK had raised concerns about restrictions to civil and political rights in the country.After the first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda was cancelled, Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the scheme had ""never been a serious policy"" and described it as a ""shambles"" and ""shameful"".When the policy was first announced, the Liberal Democrats accused the government of ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees.PA MediaBoris Johnson held talks with Rwandan President Paul KagameDuring his visit to Rwanda, Mr Johnson will not be visiting any of the accommodation set aside for the scheme, with his spokesman saying his time was limited.""We think that the best use of his time for this short period he's in Rwanda is to dedicate himself to some of the issues that will be raised at the summit and to work with other world leaders on some of those issues we've talked about, not least Ukraine and global security,"" he said.During a speech as part of the summit, Mr Johnson spoke of the UK's support for green energy projects in Africa, including the announcement of up to £162m investment, via British International Investment, in the hydropower sector.What happened when Israel sent its refugees to RwandaPrince Charles meets Rwandan Genocide survivorsPlan to reverse European Court Rwanda rulingsPrince Charles faces awkward trip after Rwanda rowWhy a sports reporter fled RwandaRwandan Anglican archbishop defends UK asylum planRwanda plan would have deterred me - asylum seekerWrong for court to intervene in Rwanda plan - RaabRwanda asylum flight cancelled after legal actionWhere does Rwanda flight setback leave ministers?Boris JohnsonKing Charles IIIRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61907884"

Pembrokeshire Council has said its investigation found that no confidential or personal information had been disclosed.Opposition councillors have told BBC Wales that the authority's statement does not allay their concerns that their activity could potentially have been tracked on the website. The council needs to save £28m during 2023-24, and councillors will soon be expected to vote on budget proposals. The BBC has learned that councillors received an email containing an individual link from Mr Cormack, who is the council's cabinet member for finance, prior to a budget seminar on Friday 27 January.The private individual links connect to an external website, pembs.net, which includes information about potential budget savings for the forthcoming budget, and another page for councillors to vote on various options.It is not clear why the website was set up externally rather than on the council's own server.Ex-councillor banned for illegal porn smearFarmers angry over council's plant-based diet emailOnline abuse forcing councillors to quitThe email to councillors was sent from Mr Cormack's council email address, but links to an external website which is hosted on a server that includes a number of websites, including one for his own IT business and Pembrokeshire Liberal Democrats. Mr Cormack, a Liberal Democrat, is described on his corporate website as a ""proven IT leader"" with 20 years' experience in corporate IT.It is understood concerns about the security of the website were raised during the budget seminar, which was held at County Hall, Haverfordwest.After the row, councillors refused to vote on possible budget options using the website. One of those who was unhappy was councillor Jacob Williams. When approached by the BBC, Mr Williams said that because Mr Cormack was the administrator of the site, he was theoretically ""able to record each and every member's interactions and save that data to use for his own purposes"", which would amount to a ""gross breach of trust"".Another opposition councillor, who did not want to be named, told the BBC the website in question could have breached data protection laws, as he claims the website had no obvious privacy or cookie policy.

He was given the nickname ""30p Lee"" after comments in Parliament when he suggested people needed to learn how to cook and budget ""properly"".""We can make a meal for about 30p a day and this is cooking from scratch,"" he said.He's also said that poor families were ""more resourceful"" in the past - and was criticised by the Hope Not Hate campaign for saying he had sympathy with people protesting outside hotels providing refuge for asylum seekers.But despite his tendency to create media storms, his supporters in the Conservative Party believe the former Labour councillor can connect with so-called ""red wall"" voters in the Midlands and the north of England in a way that others can't.Labour calls for action over Tory MP Islamist claimsKhan criticises PM for failing to condemn MP's remarksDowden declines to say whether MP's remarks IslamophobicBorn in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, to a family of coal miners, he followed in the footsteps of his father by working in the area's pits for 10 years after leaving school. After separating from his partner, he raised his two sons as a single parent on what he described as a ""meagre wage"". ""I've been that man that has to put five quid in the gas meter on a Sunday night and been watching the meter spin round all week,"" he told TalkTV in 2022.He went on to volunteer at a local Citizens Advice centre before working in hostels for homeless care leavers. His first job in politics was working in the office of local Labour MP Gloria De Piero, serving as a district councillor at the same time. In February 2018 he was suspended from the council's Labour group after hiring a digger and placing concrete blocks to stop travellers illegally camping in a car park. A month later he defected to the Tories, saying his former party had been ""taken over by the hard-left"". In the 2019 general election the Brexit-supporter stood as the Conservative candidate for Ashfield, winning the seat from Labour. The constituency was one of many Leave-supporting areas to turn blue in Boris Johnson's landslide victory over Jeremy Corbyn.

He faced mockery after he appeared to be caught setting up a door knock while out canvassing, accompanied by journalist Michael Crick. During the visit a microphone picked up Mr Anderson asking a voter not to mention he was his friend during filming.There was further criticism for comments suggesting ""nuisance tenants"" living on a council estate should be forced to live in tents and pick vegetables. Mr Anderson continued to attract attention for his strident views as an MP.During the Euro 2020 football tournament he criticised the England team for taking the knee in protest at racism and vowed to boycott their matches. He returned to the theme of budgeting, when he posted a photo on Twitter of one of his staff members to illustrate his argument that nurses on £30,000 a year didn't need to use food banks.The post, which detailed her monthly spending on rent and travel, provoked a backlash on social media.1:13Lee Anderson: ""There's not this massive use for food banks in this country""The 57-year-old's appointment as deputy party chairman by Mr Sunak came despite Mr Anderson initially backing his rival Boris Johnson in last year's leadership election. He's also been critical of the government's approach to tackling illegal immigration. In December, he wrote that he was ""putting my party on notice"" over the issue, saying the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats was ""making us the laughing stock of the world"". In a joint resignation letter, Mr Anderson and Mr Clarke-Smith said they backed rebel amendments to the Rwanda bill ""not because we are against the Rwanda legislation but because... we want it to work.""They added ""our main wish is to strengthen the legislation. This means that in order to vote for amendments we will therefore need to offer you our resignations from our roles"".The two said they believed when it came to asylum claims ""there are far too many who wish to cheat our system"" yet provisions in international and domestic law meant deportations could still be blocked under the government's bill.Many of Mr Anderson's former fellow Tory MPs in the Midlands and north of England love his outspoken style.

"1 July 2023","What's happening in Parliament this week?","What's happening in Parliament this week?1 July 2023ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentSharePA MediaThe heaviest legislative action will be around the Illegal Migration Bill, where peers look likely to add to the four defeats they've already inflicted on the government (details below). With the government keen to get its bill through unscathed, the expectation is that there will be a rapid ping-pong exercise, possibly involving several rounds of amendments bouncing between the Commons and Lords in a single day. In this case, there could be as many as 14 issues in play, but expect that number to come down rapidly, with the strongest Lords resistance likely to be on those amendments involving respected crossbenchers and bishops, as well as Labour and the Lib Dems. But all sides understand the political heat generated by this issue, so the wider political picture will inform their tactics. Between processing amendments from peers, MPs will spend much of their week on Estimates Day debates. The constitutional theory is that this is how government spending is approved by the Commons; the practice is that the debates focus on specific issues identified by select committees - and the great mass of spending is approved in brief, empty, legislative rituals. Government defeated in Lords over small boats billIllegal migrants plan could cost £6bn over two yearsThere's plenty of important committee action. Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is trying to set up an evidence session on the crisis facing Thames Water, with minister Rebecca Pow, regulators and current and former Thames Water managers - as I write, the timing and details have not been settled. Monday 3 July Commons: (14.30 BST) Home Office Questions. Any Government statements or urgent questions will follow from 15:30 (the NHS workforce plan looks a likely candidate). The main debate will be the second reading of the Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill: this is aimed at local councils and other public bodies disinvesting in Israel - although the bill will provide for a wider ban on political or moral disapproval of foreign states ""influencing certain economic decisions"".Labour has fired back a fatal amendment to try to block the bill. It acknowledges there have been ""selective and biased"" campaigns against Israel, but warns the bill could stop public bodies supporting Uyghurs and other groups facing persecution. Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs debate e-petition 600966, calling for the government to increase the HMRC Mileage Rate from 45p per mile to 60p per mile - it notes the rate has been the same since 2011. The petition attracted 41,589 signatures. Committees: Public Accounts (16:00) quizzes senior officials from the Department of Health and Social Care on access to urgent and emergency care. Justice (14:30) questions Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill KC on issues including long delays in court cases coming to trial, the investigation and prosecution of rape, and tensions between the Crown Prosecution Service and the police.  Lords: (14:30) The main debate will be the report stage (day 2 of 3) of the Illegal Migration Bill. This will include three votes held over from Wednesday, when the electronic voting system, perhaps overheated by the volume of government defeats, failed. They cover protection of LGBT people, the length of detention, and requiring the home secretary to consider a protection claim or a human rights claim where someone has not been removed from the UK within six months of the claim being deemed inadmissible. PA MediaThe Illegal Migration Bill is the government's key measure to tackle small boat crossingsThere could be four more votes after that: on protection for women, and victims of trafficking, the period of detention, and unaccompanied children. Tuesday 4 July Commons: (14:30) Energy Security and Net Zero Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Bill presented by former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, to recognise the Republic of Somaliland, a breakaway state (from Somalia) in the Horn of Africa. The main event will be an Estimates Day debate, on spending by the Department of Work and Pensions, followed by the Ministry of Justice's spending on the Prisons and Probation Service.Westminster Hall: (09:30) Labour's Yasmin Qureshi leads a debate on Srebrenica Memorial Week.  Committees: (14:00) Rishi Sunak is before the Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, for one of its regular hearings questioning the prime minister. It will cover Ukraine and security matters, the cost of living, public services, constitutional matters, and the net zero strategy/COP28. Environment Food and Rural Affairs (14:30) looks at ""puppy farming"" and the unregulated importing of puppies into the UK, and the mutilation of domestic animals, such as the ear-cropping of dogs and de-clawing of cats. Health (10:00) continues its assisted dying inquiry with evidence from Minister of State Helen Whately.Lords: (14:30) Peers will zip through a series of legislative chores - rapid, perfunctory committee consideration of private members bills, followed by brief third reading rubber-stampings of the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, and the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill. In both cases, some amendments will have to go back to MPs. That process has already taken place with the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill, where a series of government defeats have been reversed in the Commons. The word is that peers will fire back a single amendment, bundling up their remaining concerns into a call for a consultation on unfair dismissal. For dessert, peers will whiz through all stages of the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the measure that enacts the tax changes made in the Budget - as a money bill, Peers don't make any changes.Wednesday 5 July Commons: (11:30) Wales Office Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time.The main debate will be another Estimates Day one, this time on the Department of Energy's work on energy infrastructure, followed by the Department for Education's spending on adult education, post-16 education, and further education colleges.The day will end with the ritual approval of ""all outstanding estimates"" - billions of pounds of public spending approved in the blink of an eye. Westminster Hall: (09:30) Labour's Kate Osamor leads a debate on the criminalisation of victims of violence against women from ethnic minority and migrant communities; Conservative Gareth Johnson (14:30) has a debate on freehold and leasehold reform in England, in the wake of a government decision not to push forward with legislation.  Committees: Environmental Audit (14:15) hears from Chief Medical Officer for England Professor Sir Chris Whitty on air quality targets, following his recent annual report which focused on air pollution. Are cleaning products, wood burners and gas cookers bad for your health?Lords: (15:00) The main debate will be the report stage (day 3 of 3) of the Illegal Migration Bill. Expect votes on another three amendments: on a duty to provide safe and legal routes for migrants; on a requirement for the National Crime Agency to tackle organised criminal gangs involved in illegal migration; and on the Archbishop of Canterbury's amendment to require the home secretary to produce a 10-year strategy for international cooperation to tackle refugee crises. The idea is to move the focus beyond the immediate crisis, to the underlying international issues.  Thursday 6 July Commons: (09:30) Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Questions, followed by Questions to the Attorney General, and the weekly Business Statement setting out the following week's Commons agenda.After another bit of legislative ritual around government spending, with the rubber-stamping of the Supply Questions and Appropriation (Main Estimates) (No. 2) Bill, the main events will be backbench debates on building safety and social housing, to mark six years since the Grenfell Tower fire, and on the role and status of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.Westminster Hall: (13:50) The SNP's Tommy Sheppard leads a debate questioning the presence of bishops in the House of LordsLords: (11:00) Peers will debate the report stage (day 1 of 4) of the Online Safety Bill. This promises to be a much more consensual affair than other recent report stages. with an outbreak of agreement about the content of much of the bill. Watch or government amendments reflecting deals over issues where peers (and MPs before them) have been lobbying. The first example is digital minister Lord Parkinson, who has an amendment creating new offences of sharing or threatening to share intimate photographs or films, responding to a long campaign headed by former Culture Secretary Dame Maria Miller. Watch out for further compromises on other issues.Friday 7 July Lords: (10:00) Peers will debate the 75th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush generation. Normally combative Home Office minister Lord Murray of Blidworth leads for the government. Peers will also debate a report from the Communications and Digital Committee: At Risk: our creative future. Conservative Baroness Stowell of Beeston will lead. Her committee's report accused ministers of a ""complacent"" approach which risked jeopardising a successful sector of the economy.

"7 August 2023","Fines hiked for firms employing illegal migrants","Fines hiked for firms employing illegal migrants7 August 2023ShareMatt MurphyBBC NewsSharePA MediaImmigration Minister Robert Jenrick said new fines targeting employers would help to deter dangerous Channel crossingsFines for businesses and landlords who knowingly support illegal migrants are set to triple under new rules announced by the government. Firms who are found to have repeatedly employed illegal migrants could face fines of up to £60,000 per breach.The Home Office argues ""illegal working and renting are significant pull factors"" for illegal migration.Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick said the move would help deter perilous channel crossings by small boats.Under the new punishments, which come into force at the beginning of 2024, businesses will see the civil penalty for employing illegal migrants rise from £15,000 for the first offence to £45,000. Repeat offenders will see fines triple from £20,000 to £60,000. Meanwhile, landlords will have fines hiked from £80 per lodger and £1,000 per occupier for a first breach to up to £5,000 per lodger and £10,000 per occupier.Further breaches could result in penalties of to £10,000 per lodger and £20,000 per occupier, up from £500 and £3,000 respectively. ""Unscrupulous landlords and employers who allow illegal working and renting enable the business model of the evil people smugglers to continue,"" Mr Jenrick said in a statement. ""There is no excuse for not conducting the appropriate checks and those in breach will now face significantly tougher penalties.""It is unknown how many people reside in the UK illegally. A 2020 study conducted by the Greater London Authority estimated that between 594,000-745,000 undocumented people were living in the country - about 1% of the total population. Since 2018 some 4,000 civil penalties have been issued to employers for employing undocumented workers, raising more than £74m. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made tackling the number of migrants making the dangerous crossing across the channel one of his government's five main priorities. But Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said penalties issued to firms employing workers illegally had actually fallen by two-thirds since 2016, noting that arrests had also fallen. ""Strengthening penalties must be combined with stronger enforcement action if the government is serious about tackling the problems,"" the Ms Cooper said. The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael called the move ""another pointless announcement on the asylum system which will make no meaningful difference"".""A bolder fix is required by ministers, yet they are too arrogant to admit it,"" Mr Carmichael added. More than 45,000 people entered the UK via Channel crossings last year, up from about 300 in 2018.Last month, a controversial new bill was approved by Parliament which will see people removed from the UK being blocked from returning or seeking British citizenship in future.The home secretary has also been given the duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally to Rwanda or a ""safe"" third country. The move, which could see up to £6bn spent a year on detention and removal, attracted an unusually strong response from the United Nations. In a joint statement, UN human rights chief Volker Turk and the UN refugees head Filippo Grandi said the bill ""will have profound consequences for people in need of international protection"".""This new legislation significantly erodes the legal framework that has protected so many, exposing refugees to grave risks in breach of international law,"" Mr Grandi said.The Home Office defended the bill and said the government took its international obligations seriously - noting that nothing in the bill required the government to act in a way which was incompatible with international law.The UK had the fifth highest number of asylum applications in Europe, behind Germany, France, Spain and Austria in 2022. With 217,735 applications, Germany had a quarter of all first-time asylum applications within the EU.How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Illegal Migration Bill to become law after Lords challengeHow many people cross the Channel in small boats?UK immigrationSuella BravermanRishi SunakMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-66422763"

But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the measures were ""too little, too late"".The plans received a mixed reaction from the Conservative backbenchers, with some calling it ""tripe"" and others saying it did not go far enough.The government faced accusations that it had timed the announcement to distract from the release of the Sue Gray report into lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.But the claims were denied by No 10.1:17Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"".Households across the country have faced soaring costs in recent months as the prices of food, fuel and energy have all rocketed, with inflation hitting a 40-year high.The government has been under growing pressure to act, especially after energy regulator Ofgem warned of an additional rise to bills of £800 in the autumn. The Liberal Democrats first put forward the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies - which have peaked as the economy restarted after the pandemic - in November, with Labour outlining its own version in January.The SNP has also called for such a measure.The parties said the money raised could go towards helping those households hardest hit by the cost of living increases.Initially, the idea was rejected by ministers, including Boris Johnson, who warned it could ""deter"" investment.But both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak subsequently softened their stance, and now the policy U-turn has been confirmed. 'Kicking and screaming'Making a statement in the Commons, the chancellor said the inflation faced by the UK was causing ""acute distress for the people of this country"" and he knew people were worried. But, Mr Sunak added: ""This government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right - as we did during the pandemic.""He confirmed the government would introduce a ""temporary targeted energy profits levy"" charged at a rate of 25% on profits of oil and gas companies to fund ""significant support for the British people"".However, he said his ""sensible middle ground"" plan included a new investment allowance, so ""for every pound a company invests they will get back 90% in tax relief - the more the company invests the less tax they will pay"". Mr Sunak said: ""We should not be ideological about this, we should be pragmatic.""It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments.""The chancellor said the tax would then be removed when energy prices returned to normal levels. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said the government had been ""dragged kicking and screaming"" to its new policy position.She added: ""The chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills.""

And they did get a clearer idea of future energy prices this week.But - to be more cynical - the government had a particularly uncomfortable day on Wednesday with the publication of the Sue Gray report into Downing Street gatherings.Boris Johnson has made it clear that he's desperate to stop talking about parties. An announcement of billions of pounds of assistance for households certainly helps to move the agenda on. Downing Street deny that the timing of this has anything to do with Partygate. But plenty of opposition MPs won't buy that argument.The package of measures announced by Mr Sunak was attacked by many of his opponents for not going far enough. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the government for failing to cut taxes for workers, pointing to the new health and social care levy introduced in April amid the cost of living crisis. He tweeted: ""Sunak's like a thief who steals your car and then wants you to be grateful when he returns the steering wheel.""The SNP's Kirsty Blackman said the government had ""listened to a certain extent"", but had ""failed"" on a number of measures, especially her party's call to uprate benefits in line with inflation. She told the BBC the one-off payment was ""kicking the can down the road"" and those hit hardest could face more difficulties in the future. 'Outrageous'When it came to Mr Sunak's own benches, Conservatives appeared split on both the policies and how to fund them.Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to the socialists by raising taxes on businesses"", adding a windfall tax was ""not the Conservative way"" of doing things.Another backbench Tory, Craig Mackinlay, said he was ""appalled that a Conservative chancellor could come up with this tripe"", calling the tax ""outrageous"" and ""inherently wrong"".Former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, however, called the chancellor's statement ""a good start and welcome"", but added: ""More needs to be done. ""Our response to this economic crisis should have three goals at its centre: adequate financial support for the poorest, helping those who are able into work, and reducing the burden of taxation.""

"4 November 2022","Migrants being stranded in London was a mistake, says minister","Migrants being stranded in London was a mistake, says minister4 November 2022ShareJames GregoryBBC NewsSharePA MediaA coach arriving at the Manston processing centre in Kent this weekMistakes were made after two groups of migrants were left stranded in London this week, the government has admitted.Home Office minister Chris Philp said there had been a ""misunderstanding"", after people were mistakenly taken from the Manston centre in Kent and left at Victoria station.But he said there had been ""dramatic improvement"" in conditions at Manston.It comes amid a crisis for the government after criticism of its handling of overcrowding at the centre.The Home Office was further criticised after it emerged two groups of migrants had been taken to Victoria Railway Station with nowhere to go.Around 11 migrants who left the Manston processing centre and arrived at the station on Tuesday did not have accommodation.After receiving help from volunteers at a homeless charity who liaised with the Home Office, the group was then taken to stay at a hotel in Norwich. The Home Office said officials had worked ""at pace"" to find accommodation for them.Less than 24 hours afterwards, a second group of migrants was also taken to the capital without accommodation. The group slept rough on the streets until housing was provided, according to the local authority.""Both groups of people told immigration officials at Manston they had addresses to go to, so friends and family,"" Mr Philp told Sky News.""Obviously, that turned out subsequently not to be the case. Quite how that misunderstanding arose, maybe it was lost in translation, I don't know, but clearly they have now all been looked after."" Cold, hungry migrants left stranded in LondonHow many migrants cross the Channel in small boats?Mr Philp's comments come after the government faced criticism following reports that Manston was holding migrants, including families, for four weeks, in breach of the law. It is intended that people stay for no more than 24 hours while their claim is processed.At most, 1,600 migrants should be at the processing centre at any one time - the MP for the area said that figure was more like 4,000 on Monday.Mr Philp told BBC Breakfast that there had been a ""substantial effort"" to reduce the number of people at Manston. The number has now fallen to 2,600, with 1,200 people taken off site in the last four days, No 10 said.He added that he had seen a ""dramatic improvement"" with work carried out on facilities and additional accommodation built. But Mr Philp also told Times Radio it was a ""bit of a cheek"" for people to ""start complaining about the conditions when you've illegally entered a country without necessity"" - remarks which have since been criticised, including by the Liberal Democrats who said they reveal a ""callous complacency"".Asked if Mr Philp spoke for the government with this comment, Downing Street's official spokesperson said people seeking asylum in the UK ""deserve to be treated with compassion and respect"".EPAPolicing minister Chris PhilpAddressing the instances of migrants being stranded in the capital, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for the home secretary to launch an ""urgent and thorough"" review to ensure ""the abandonment of those seeking refuge can never happen again"". Westminster City Council's Labour leader Adam Hug said the ""chaos"" of the situation meant local services and charities were ""having to pick up the slack"".Mr Hug told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the misunderstanding between immigration officials and  migrants this week could have been down to language barriers.""It could be people who are just desperately wanting to get out of a horrible situation that is on the ground in Manston,"" he added.Mr Hug said that some of the migrants who were bussed into the capital on Wednesday were put on a coach to Norwich 12 hours later. But Stephen Evans, chief executive of Norwich Council, has said the Home Office did not give its local officials any warning that the group would be arriving in the city. He said he first heard about it in a news article.""We hadn't been told. We don't know who they are and we don't know where they've gone to in the city,"" he said.He added that councils need to know where migrants are for safeguarding reasons, adding that the Home Office usually gives local leaders just a few days' notice when it comes to opening a hotel for migrants in their area. Damian Green, the Conservative MP for Ashford in Kent and former immigration minister, said the Home Office had ""taken it eye off the ball"" and had been concentrating on plans to send migrants to Rwanda when it should have been be focussed on processing asylum claims more quickly.He said if asylum seekers were quickly assessed then the need for housing thousands in hotels would be avoided.Speaking to the Today programme, Mr Green accused the Home Office of housing migrants in hotels often ""against the advice of police"" and local authorities, adding that his own home county of Kent was ""really under strain"".The Home Office said it was taking urgent decisions to alleviate issues at Manston, including sourcing alternative accommodation. Immigration minister Robert Jenrick was heckled by some residents in Dover on Friday as he met with the town's MP, Natalie Elphicke, according to PA news agency.Cold, hungry migrants left stranded in LondonRefugees and asylum seekersLondonMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63512372"
"25 April 2024","Greater Manchester mayor hopefuls clash over key issues in BBC debate","Greater Manchester mayor hopefuls clash over key issues in BBC debate25 April 2024ShareEwan GawneBBC NewsShareBBCThe debate was filmed in Stretford on MondayPeople across the 10 boroughs that make up Greater Manchester will head to the polls next week to choose a new mayor.Six candidates are standing in the election to lead the city region's combined authority over the next four years. The role was created in 2017.An hour-long BBC North West debate, filmed on Monday between five of the candidates, will be screened on BBC One and the BBC iPlayer from 20:00 BST.The would-be mayors discussed their top priorities and most pressing issues.The election hopefuls took questions from the audienceThe mayoral role was only created seven years ago when additional powers and extra cash were handed to the Greater Manchester Combined Authority - the body that brings together its 10 local councils.Among some of the powers the successful candidate will inherit are:Control over some public transportThe ability to set region-wide planning policiesA £115m pot of cash to redevelop brownfield sitesThe five hopefuls faced questions from members of the audience on subjects including public transport, technical skills education, and clean air zones.When they were asked how they would help young people buy first-time homes, Conservative candidate Laura Evans said not enough affordable houses had been built, particularly in areas outside of Manchester city centre.Labour's Andy Burnham, bidding for a third term as mayor, said he had brought through Places for Everyone, a 15-year development plan aiming to build 175,000 new homes. He also promised to crack down on bad landlords in the rental sector. Jake Austin, from the Liberal Democrats, said it was a case of ""build more homes"" to lower the cost of mortgages and rents, while protecting areas of greenbelt with a ""brownfield first approach"".Green Party candidate Hannah Spencer said she would consider rent controls to help people save towards a deposit, and improve the quality of homes being built. Reform UK's Dan Barker said there was enough brownfield land available to boost the supply of housing, after criticising the previous mayor for what he saw as slow progress bringing a housing plan forward.The debate will be broadcast on BBC One at 20:00 BSTThe five candidates to feature in the debate represent parties which have a track record of support in previous elections for the Mayor of Greater Manchester.

"14 April 2022","England elections: Why a third of London's councillors are quitting","England elections: Why a third of London's councillors are quitting14 April 2022ShareTim DonovanPolitical Editor, BBC LondonSharePA MediaAlmost a third of London's councillors are standing down ahead of the local elections, according to data obtained by the BBC. Figures show 546 councillors are heading for the exit, out of a total of 1,769. But what are the reasons behind this exodus? It's thought to be one of the highest turnovers of elected representatives since councils were created in 1964. The strain of austerity in local government is seen as one reason for the departures, according to one expert.Another factor is the impact of Covid-19, with councillors fatigued from the pressures of helping people during the pandemic or reassessing their own personal priorities. There's concern it could mean a loss of experience that will affect the quality of local services, although some counter that fresh talent could energise town halls. London elections 2022: What do borough councils do?How to vote in the London council electionsAcross London there are 32 boroughs, with councillors falling into two categories.  A leader appoints a cabinet of colleagues who are put in charge of individual portfolios like housing, environment and social care. Together they decide policies and make the key decisions. The remainder are backbenchers - both from the ruling and opposition parties - who deal with the case-loads of people in their areas, scrutinise and challenge policy and approve major decisions. 3:05London elections 2022: The area run by four local councilsCouncils have faced unprecedented financial pressure since the austerity policies of the coalition government formed in 2010. At the same time they've contended with the turmoil of Brexit, the pandemic and an influx of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and now Ukraine. Jenna Goldberg from London Communications Agency - which has done a guide to the upcoming local elections - says there is a mix of factors.""Ten years of austerity and two years of frontline pandemic response have likely and understandably exhausted people,"" she says. ""There is also a real and increasing perception that councillors' personal safety is at risk, for which many blame social media.""'Toll of the job'Top of the capital's council exodus is Kingston-upon-Thames where 23 of the 47 councillors are calling it a day. Sir Ed Davey - Kingston MP and leader of the Liberal Democrats - says there's a ""strong degree of weariness"" from functioning during the pandemic. ""It's personal reasons for some people but it's also the toll the job takes,"" he explains.""It's hard to get things done and build relationships when you're doing so much by Zoom."" PA MediaSir Ed Davey won the Lib Dem leadership race in August 2020In Croydon, too, a sizeable proportion of councillors are heading for the exit - 29 out of 70. The Labour-run authority has been grappling with a financial crisis. About a third of councillors are departing in Camden, Lambeth, Lewisham, Newham, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Wandsworth and Westminster. In Wandsworth, 15 Conservative councillors - nearly half the ruling Tory group - are standing down. Croydon CouncilFormer Croydon Council bosses were blamed for failing to fulfil their statutory duties, in a damning report into its financesThey have an average service of 12 years and, as Tory leader Ravi Govindia suggests, some have reached ""vintage"" status. ""They have served well and feel it's time to move on,"" Mr Govindia says. ""Only one has been in my recent cabinet, so it doesn't challenge stability.""In fact, changing backbenchers can be refreshing, and provides new talent to promote.""PA MediaVotes have been slipping away from Labour in recent London by-electionsMany councillors have gone willingly but a good number of departures have not been voluntary. In what is effectively the one-party borough of Newham, 22 of the 60 Labour councillors are standing down. Nine of them have been deselected. In Camden, 17 of the 42 Labour-serving Labour councillors are on the move, a number helped on their way by a party eager for new faces. Westminster Council has come under fire for the much-derided Marble Arch MoundWestminster is bidding farewell to 19 councillors in a borough which is bring reduced in size from 60 to 54 seats. One council communications chief said there was a ""generational shift"", with many younger candidates coming forward.'Hard grind'""I think's there's been disillusionment with politics in general, combined with a sense of  fatigue,"" he said. ""As a councillor you do a lot of the hard grind, nitty-gritty in the community.  ""Then you get things like 'Partygate' for the Tories and the impact of Jeremy Corbyn if you're Labour. And councillors just think 'why am I always fighting against national trends and the national picture?'""  In most boroughs the number of seats is being cut and wards reconfigured and one current council leader says boundary changes have also been a factor in some departures. ""If the seat and the area you've been representing for a while changes, and you're having to stand in a ward covering a new area, some sitting councillors don't want to go through that.""London elections 2022: What's at stake?Mayor of London: Two decades in the spotlightCost of living likely to dominate England electionsHow to vote in the London council electionsCroydon Council faces £67.5m bill over 'failings'Kingston upon ThamesWestminster CouncilLondonCamden London Borough CouncilEngland elections 2022Newham London Borough CouncilKingston Upon Thames London Borough Council","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-61105717"

"21 April 2024","Greater Manchester elections: New party adds fresh dynamic","Greater Manchester elections: New party adds fresh dynamic21 April 2024ShareKevin FitzpatrickGreater Manchester political reporter, BBC NewsShareBBCElections take place across all of Greater Manchester's 10 boroughs on 2 MayPolitics here in Greater Manchester can be pretty predictable.With less than two weeks of campaigning left, we can safely say that whatever happens at the polls on 2 May, nine of our 10 councils will continue to be run by Labour afterwards.That's both due to the number of councillors it already has and the seats which are up for re-election this time around..As part of the electoral cycle, only a third of seats are up for grabs.There will usually be ups and downs for the main parties, and there's been a fair bit of excitement for the hyper-locals in recent years, but rarely has a new dynamic presented itself with such gusto so close to polling day.Fresh from victory in one of the most eventful parliamentary by-elections in recent memory in Rochdale, there's a new party in town talking up its chances of a wider political earthquake across our patch.After January's stomping win in the town, new MP George Galloway and his Workers Party of Britain have injected an unexpected sense of jeopardy into this year's contests. Understandably, Rochdale is the party's main focus. Some 13 candidates are standing in the town, but it has others in Manchester and Bury and the party says it is working with other ""anti-Labour"" parties elsewhere to attract voters.The main parties are hoping what happened in Rochdale was a one off, an anomaly. Privately, Labour is confident it would have won had it not disowned its candidate over alleged anti-semitic remarks. Labour claims this gifted Galloway victory.But it's clear Mr Galloway's policy of supporting the Palestinian cause as the Gaza conflict continues will again win him support in predominantly Muslim wards. In Rochdale that's thought to be three or four, but Mr Galloway's also trying to widen his appeal, promising big changes at the town hall while recruiting one of his opponents in the by-election, local independent Billy Howarth, to stand as part of his team.While the situation in Gaza is understandably important to many people, the main parties are working on the assumption that it'll be other issues that focus a majority of people's minds.Your guide to the 2024 Greater Manchester mayoral electionThe elections taking place in Cheshire this yearLocal elections 2024: Who can I vote for?In Rochdale and beyond, Labour argues it has hard-working councillors and a good track record of running local authorities in the face of government cuts and rising costs. In Bolton, Labour hopes to regain full control of the council after running it as a minority administration for the last 12 months.Over in Stockport, it's the Liberal Democrats who are hoping to secure their grip on power after a couple of years of leading their own minority administration.Sewage in the rivers continues to be one of their main campaign points, with a demand for better local NHS and dentistry services also on the door-step cribsheets.For the Conservatives, last year's election saw them completely wiped out in Stockport and they'll be very wary of the national polls on voting intentions rolling out around here. Understandably, they really are trying to turn residents' attention to local concerns, including protection of the greenbelt which they say Labour has failed to do with its controversial Places for Everyone plan. 'Challenge'Meanwhile Reform UK supporters have a spring in their step following polling data suggesting it will increase its share of the vote nationally. The party is focussing particularly on Trafford, Bolton and Wigan.The Green Party is also quietly optimistic that it can build on the successes of recent years.It has picked up councillors in Manchester, Tameside and Stockport, in addition to the traditionally fertile ground of Trafford.During the last decade, hyper-local parties and independent groups have had increasing success.Sustaining that momentum, and even keeping their gang together, has sometimes proved a challenge, though.They will all play their part again this year, however, with the aim of giving areas often on the edge of the borough a bigger voice in council meetings.In Salford, the elected City Mayor is effectively the council leader and there are four candidates in the running.  GettyWho will secure the most votes in the Greater Manchester mayoral election?Across the whole of Greater Manchester, meanwhile, residents will be able to vote for the Metro Mayor.There are six candidates standing in that election. Voting will take place on 2 May with most council counts taking place either overnight or on Friday or Saturday. Salford's will be on Sunday.The count for the Greater Manchester metro mayor will take place on 4 May.Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram?

"27 May 2024","Labour's Rachel Reeves rules out increasing income tax or NI","Labour's Rachel Reeves rules out increasing income tax or NI27 May 2024ShareJennifer McKiernan, Dharshini David and Chas GeigerBBC NewsShare1:24Reeves: No return to austerity under LabourLabour has said there will be no rises in income tax or National Insurance if it wins the general election - but some spending cuts have not been ruled out. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she did not want to make any spending cuts. But she was ""under no illusion about the scale of the challenge"" and would face ""difficult decisions"", she said. The Conservatives have cut National Insurance twice and said they aim to scrap it when circumstances allow.Economic Secretary to the Treasury Bim Afolami said Ms Reeves' comments showed this was ""just the same old Labour Party who have no plan to cut taxes and instead are leaving hard-working families to foot the bill for their unfunded spending commitments"". The choice at the election was between ""a clear and bold plan to cut taxes, and end the double tax on work, under Rishi Sunak, or going back to square one with the same old Labour Party, who as soon as they run out of money will come after yours"", he added.   Ms Reeves told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg Labour supported lower taxes, but she would not put forward ""unfunded proposals"". Pressed repeatedly on her tax plans, she said: ""What I want and Keir [Starmer] wants is taxes on working people to be lower and we certainly won't be increasing income tax or national insurance if we win at the election.""We opposed the increases to national insurance when Rishi Sunak put those forward as chancellor.Finances a 'dark cloud' over election campaign, says IFSLabour vows to fund NHS pledges by tackling tax dodgersHunt hints at another National Insurance tax cutA simple guide to the 4 July general election ""Unlike the Conservatives, who have already racked up £64bn of unfunded tax cuts in just three days of this campaign, I will never play fast and loose with the public finances, I will never put forward unfunded proposals.""Labour has claimed the government's ambition to abolish national insurance contributions for workers would cost £46bn, but the Conservatives have said this will not happen before 2030 and only if the economy grows sufficiently.The Tories claim Labour's spending commitments would leave a £38.5bn black hole in government finances, equivalent, Mr Afolami said, to a ""tax rise of £2,094 on every hardworking family"". Labour has dismissed the figures. On Saturday, independent think tank The Institute of Fiscal Studies issued a stark warning about the challenges awaiting the next government, saying the state of public finances hung over the election campaign ""like a dark cloud"".What is the Tory national service plan and how might it work?It warned that more tax rises or cuts to public services could lie ahead, whoever won on 4 July.Ms Reeves promised there was ""not going to be a return to austerity"", saying commitments to boost frontline services were a ""down payment on the changes that we want to make"".""That money for our NHS, the additional police - 13,000 additional police and community officers - and the 6,500 additional teachers in our schools, they are all fully costed and fully funded promises because unless things are fully costed and fully funded, frankly, you can't believe they're going to happen.""She said Labour would raise some of the money by ending the VAT exemption for private schools and by extending the windfall tax on energy firms. The party has also said it will raise £5bn a year by tackling tax avoidance and evasion, and £2.6bn by closing ""loopholes"" in the government's plans to abolish non-dom exemptions. Non-doms are UK residents whose permanent home for tax purposes is abroad, meaning they do not have to pay UK tax on money they earn overseas.Spending review""But in the end we have to grow the economy, we have to turn around this dire economic performance,"" Ms Reeves added.  Later, during a campaign visit to Ossett, West Yorkshire, when asked if she would rule out rises in other taxes including VAT and capital gains tax, she said: ""There is nothing in our plans that requires further tax rises.""While the shadow chancellor promised a rapid injection of funds to boost the number of NHS appointments and the recruitment of teachers, other unprotected areas of public spending such as local council services and justice could face cuts if Labour sticks to its rule that it will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending .  Ms Reeves ruled out setting a timetable for when a Labour government would increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income, saying there would be a review of defence costs which had ""got out of control under this government"".Mr Sunak has pledged that the defence budget will rise to the 2.5% figure by 2030. A spending review would take place if Labour won the election, the shadow chancellor said, and a ""fiscal lock"" would be introduced, meaning any significant and permanent tax and spending changes would require a full accompanying forecast from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). PA MediaLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey launched his party's campaign battle bus in Whittlesford, CambridgeshireThe OBR normally needs 10 weeks' notice to produce a forecast, and scrutiny of opposition party plans is not allowed. This means there would need to be a delay between the result of the general election and any spending actions, in order for the OBR to comprehensively incorporate and evaluate those policies if Labour was to follow through on its commitment for a full process.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had ""already pledged not to raise taxes for ordinary people"". ""People are paying too much tax under the Conservatives - the Conservatives have raised taxes to a record amount,"" he added. Speaking in Cambridgeshire, Sir Ed also said the Lib Dems were ""excited"" about the campaign and could ""beat the Tories where Labour can not"". The SNP accused Labour of trying to ""fool"" voters about its spending plans.  Drew Hendry, the party's economy spokesperson, said Labour had a ""devastating plan to slash funding for public services by billions of pounds"".

"27 December 2022","Police are solving only 1% of catalytic converter thefts, data suggests","Police are solving only 1% of catalytic converter thefts, data suggests27 December 2022ShareChas GeigerBBC NewsShareGetty Images Converters contain precious metals attractive to thievesTens of thousands of catalytic converter thefts are going unsolved, with only 1% of cases resulting in someone being charged, figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats suggest.Data from 20 police forces in England and Wales for 2017-2021 indicate a suspect was charged in only 548 cases.Catalytic converters fitted in car exhaust systems reduce their emission of toxic gases and pollutants.Thieves are attracted by the valuable metals the devices contain.  Police say converters can often be removed in under a minute, and are most frequently stolen in car parks, before being sold to scrapyards, online or shipped out of the country.  Hybrid vehicles are most commonly targeted as their metals are more valuable, but any vehicle can be at risk of catalytic converter theft.The Home Office says it has national programmes to target metal theft, including catalytic converters.Catalytic converter thefts prompts driver warningCatalytic converter thieves target hospital car parkCatalytic converter theft up amid metal price riseThe police figures were disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request.  In the 20 police areas where full information was provided, a total of 50,223 thefts of catalytic converters were reported in the five-year period.  Full figures from some of the biggest forces - including West Midlands Police and Greater Manchester Police - were not available. In the 20 force areas surveyed, the number of thefts surged from 742 reported in 2017 to 19,451 in 2020, before falling in 2021 - the first full year of the Covid pandemic - to 15,780. By far the highest number of thefts from 2017-2021 - 36,586 - occurred in London. Just 544 were solved. In Hertfordshire, in 2020, 915 cases were recorded; in South Yorkshire, the figure was 669. No one was charged in either police area in that year. The Liberal Democrats have called for more to be done to crack down on the problem, including more visible community policing to deter thieves. 'Theft epidemic' The party said the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto promise to recruit 20,000 more police officers by March 2023 had stalled. Home Office figures show that by 30 September, 15,343 extra officers had been recruited. Richmond Park MP, and Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, Sarah Olney said: ""There is a catalytic converter theft epidemic across many parts of the country, but far too often the gangs responsible are getting away with it.""At the very least, people should be able to expect that if something is stolen from their vehicle it will be properly investigated.""Victims were ""not just massively inconvenienced but often left out of pocket and hit by higher insurance costs"", she added. The cost of replacing a catalytic converter is put at between £150 and £800, depending on the type of car and the complexity of the job.  Crime preventionA Home Office spokesperson said: ""We recognise the impact that theft can have on victims and we want offenders charged and brought to justice in the courts.""Since the National Infrastructure Crime Reduction Partnership was set up in 2020, there has been significant success in tackling metal theft through co-ordinated national action against scrap metal dealers -  including a marked increase in enforcement action from police and partner agencies.""During two weeks of national action to tackle catalytic converter and other metal theft, 64 arrests were made and more than 1,000 converters and other stolen items were recovered, the spokesperson added.Police say that although catalytic converter thefts are increasing, there are steps that can be taken to protect a vehicle.They suggest asking a car dealer for advice on approved locks or guards, registering the converter and marking it with a forensic marker.    Alternatively, they say, try to make sure the vehicle is parked in a garage overnight, or in a secure compound if it is a commercial vehicle.  Otherwise, police add, park in an area that is well-lit and overlooked, and try to park so the converter can not be easily reached by potential thieves. Vehicles that sit high above the road are said to be particularly vulnerable.Catalytic converter thefts prompts driver warningCatalytic converter theft up amid metal price riseLockdown surge in catalytic converter theftsHome OfficeCrimeLiberal DemocratsMotoring","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64057742"
"30 April 2021","Elections 2021: What is the future of Suffolk school buses?","Elections 2021: What is the future of Suffolk school buses?30 April 2021ShareShareBBCSome parents in Suffolk have to drive their children to school as they are unable to get a free busIn the village of Orford in Suffolk a free bus takes children 12 miles (19km) to Farlingaye High School but eight Year 7 and 8 pupils have to go on a minibus, at a cost of £5 a day, because there is a school two and half miles (4km) closer.It is due to Suffolk County County's ""nearest only"" policy, started in 2018, when the Conservative-run authority revised school transport arrangements.Amongst other changes, it means Year 7 and 8 pupils in Orford would only get free transport to SET Saxmundham School.With all seats on the authority up for election on 6 May, what is the future of school transport in the county?Carl Humphrey says there are other rural villages in Suffolk who have paid for minibuses to transport children to schoolCarl Humphrey, who lives in Orford, has one child on the free transport and one on the paid-for minibus and says he is ""disgruntled and angry"".""We can't afford to travel by car daily,"" he said.""The children's education is paramount and we want the best opportunity for our children in the village.""Mr Humphrey explained the local primary school was a feeder school for Farlingaye and ""there's many generations that go and continue to go to the high school"".He said he did not expect transport to be free, but wanted it to be subsidised by the council and for the authority to organise it.""Councillors should come out and get on the bus with the children and see how rural we are,"" he said.He added Orford was ""one of many rural communities"" that had organised their own school transport.Farlingaye High School is 12 miles (19km) away from the village of OrfordConservative Matthew Hicks, who is standing in Thredling, said as parents could choose a school which was not their nearest, the council had to ""step back"" from transporting those pupils.But he said if his party remained in charge of the council the policy would be reviewed.""We'll have a look at what works and what doesn't, so there could be tweaks,"" he said.""It's about should the taxpayer in Suffolk be paying for you to go to school or just to your nearest school?""We are always weighing up these difficult choices.""Conservative Matthew Hicks, Andrew Stringer from the Green Party, Labour's Sarah Adams, and Penny Sutton from the Liberal Democrats (clockwise)But the opposition parties disagree and all describe the policy as a ""disaster"".Andrew Stringer from the Green Party, a candidate in Upper Gipping, said: ""It has split villages, even families and streets, it's absolutely ridiculous.""We need to get children to school safely and sustainably, we have to find the money to do this.""He said school buses should be part of a ""comprehensive strategy for public transport"" including the county council becoming a bus operator itself.How do Suffolk councils spend your money?Council faces £23m budget shortfall in pandemicTwo children's centres 'saved' in council plansLabour's Sarah Adams, standing in St John's, admitted school transport ""has always been an issue"" in Suffolk.But she said it was ""utter nonsense children are being split from brothers and sisters"".Ms Adams said the cost to the council of appeals over free places would have paid for the buses.She said it was affordable to provide transport for all pupils and in many cases ""there are spare seats on [council] buses"".""It is unfair and we would reverse it completely,"" she added.The free bus (left) and the paid for minibus (right) which both serve Orford for Farlingaye High SchoolPenny Otton from the Liberal Democrats, a candidate for Thedwastre South, said she had ""never known so many parents up in arms"".She said about 700 parents were paying for transport to secondary schools ""they were always under the impression they would go to"", and receive council transport.The Lib Dems would ""consider"" reversing the policy, she said, but added school transport was ""a necessary expense"".She said: ""Having parents driving their children is against our commitment to the climate emergency.""Full details of candidates for Suffolk County Council can be found on its website.ENGLAND'S ELECTIONS: THE BASICSWhat's happening?

"3 March 2022","UK must target Putin's 'Mayfair lifestyle' with luxury goods ban, says Labour","UK must target Putin's 'Mayfair lifestyle' with luxury goods ban, says Labour3 March 2022ShareShareReutersThe UK government has been urged to place a total ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia to target the ""Mayfair lifestyle"" enjoyed by President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle.Labour's Nick Thomas-Symonds said sanctions should be placed on high-end jewellery and designer clothing.Government ministers have vowed to ""use all the tools at our disposal"" to target oligarchs.But they are facing calls to extend sanctions.Since Russia invaded Ukraine last week, the UK has frozen the bank accounts of some wealthy individuals, including Mr Putin and some of those linked to him.It has also banned Russian airline Aeroflot from landing its planes in the UK, and excluded several banks from the UK's financial system.UK sanctions target Russian banks and oligarchsGrowing numbers of firms pull back from RussiaDid the UK sanction 100 people last week?The UK's Levelling-Up Secretary, Michael Gove, is exploring the possibility of seizing UK property owned by Russian oligarchs with links to Mr Putin.The BBC understands Mr Gove raised the idea with cabinet colleagues last week, as part of a range of possible further sanctions, on trade and visas, but no final decision has been made.Recent research by campaign group Transparency International suggests £1.5bn worth of UK property has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or links to the Kremlin since 2016.  Nearly £430m worth is in the City of Westminster, while £283m is in Kensington and Chelsea.Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, tweeted on Thursday: ""We have flats that need seizing. Now.""The Liberal Democrats are calling for oligarch-owned properties to be seized and turned into temporary accommodation for Ukrainian refugees.Meanwhile, the authorities in France and Germany have seized super yachts owned by Russian tycoons Igor Sechin and Alisher Usmanov.Getty ImagesMayfair is one of London's wealthiest areasSpeaking in the House of Commons, Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds, the opposition's spokesman on international trade, said current UK sanctions did not go far enough, calling for a ""total ban on the export of luxury goods"" to Russia... so that Putin and his inner circle cannot live a Mayfair lifestyle in Moscow"".He added that, ""whether it is on clothing, on jewellery, on diamonds"", the UK should ""get a comprehensive ban in place to stop Putin and his inner circle living in luxury while barbaric, evil acts are perpetrated against the people of Ukraine"".Who's in Putin's inner circle and running the war? Abramovich must face sanctions, says StarmerInternational Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan did not commit to such a move, but said: ""We will continue to work across government to make sure that we have our UK powers... to tighten the screws so that Putin and his regime will find it more and more difficult to sustain their military campaigns, but also that they will no longer have access to their funds.""""We will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to make sure that Putin understands fully the absolutely outrageous behaviour that he's perpetrating.""Russia was Europe's fifth largest retail market in 2021, valued at £337.2bn. But, since the invasion of Ukraine started, sportswear brand Nike has said it cannot guarantee delivery to Russian customers, while fashion house Burberry has paused shipments, saying it is ""difficult to fulfil orders"" currently.Car-makers Jaguar Land Rover, Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce have halted deliveries of vehicles to Russia due to the conflict.Russia-Ukraine warRussiaLondonVladimir PutinUkraine","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60601305"

Dave Webster from the Labour Party is elected for the Royston Ward.""This discrepancy in the number of votes and the declaration of incorrect figures is not acceptable. We're very sorry that this has happened.""Following the recalculation the results for the Royston Ward are as follows:Neil Fisher, Independent: 458 (difference 212)Jonathan Paul Hood, Liberal Democrats: 132 (difference 79)Macaulay Larkin, Conservative Party: 363 (difference 196)Dave Webster, Labour Party: 1,085 (difference 551)All paperwork and data from the count is being made available to the Electoral Commission and to candidates and agents, Barnsley Council said.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"10 October 2017","Greens will stick up for 'the little guy' says co-leader","Greens will stick up for 'the little guy' says co-leader10 October 2017ShareShare1:40Greens told to look on the bright side after disappointing electionThe Green Party will stick up for the ""little guy"" as they fight for a fairer economic system, co-leader Jonathan Bartley has told activists.He told its conference he wanted more public input into funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". While his party had ""suffered"" at the hands of the two-party system, he said Green ideas were now ""common currency"". It ""will be the most influential"" party in 21st Century politics, he added.In June's election, the Green Party of England and Wales saw their vote share fall as 82% of voters backed the Conservatives or Labour. It got 1.6% of the vote, down on 3.8% in 2015, as it failed to make hoped-for breakthroughs in target seats in Bristol, Norwich and Oxford. Mixed feelings among Greens about election dealsNevertheless, Mr Bartley said the Greens had succeeded in setting the political agenda by making the case for the introduction of the Living Wage and keeping climate change high up the agenda.""At times, it might not feel like we are winning but where we lead, others follow. Our London Assembly members forced a Living Wage. Our MEPs stood up for refugees when others stood back. And in Parliament, we have consistently kept climate change on the agenda,"" he told the annual gathering. ""And you know what. I believe we will be the most influential party in 21st Century politics."" Outlining the Green vision for a new economy, he re-iterated his party's call for a guaranteed universal basic income, for Universal Credit to be scrapped and called for banks to invest in ""the kinds of bonds and shares and trusts that hold communities together"". His party, he argued, believed in everyone having an economic stake in society, through community-owned energy suppliers and ""participatory budgeting"" of local services.Morale boostAnalysis by BBC political correspondent Leila NathooAt a meat-free conference in the pretty surrounds of Harrogate, Green Party members have been digesting their disappointing election result in June, when they polled around 525,000 votes - half their previous tally.But while the mood among the few hundred delegates gathered in Yorkshire is reflective - it's certainly not despondent. Yes, party members admit the snap election caught them off guard and they were squeezed by Jeremy Corbyn's resurgent Labour party, whose agenda encroached on territory previously claimed by the Greens.And there has been considerable debate about whether the party was right to stand aside 22 candidates in marginal seats to give Labour or the Lib Dems a clear run at trying to beat the Tories.One of those candidates told me she thought Green voters should have been able to choose the party they wanted to, and thought anyone prone to making tactical choices would have done so anyway. Another described the decision as ""surrender"" - seeing as there was no real payback by Labour or the Lib Dems by coming out strongly for electoral reform. There are others though (including the leadership) who believe the Hung Parliament was, in part, a consequence of the Greens not fielding candidates in certain seats - and that it demonstrated a spirit of co-operation among parties. But generally across the conference, there is a sense of optimism that the Greens do still have a place and a role. ""Speaking truth to power"" was the slogan of co-leader Jonathan Bartley's speech. On issues such as tackling climate change, he said the Greens' ""voice of truth"" had never been more important. And there was his commitment to a second Brexit referendum on the final deal agreed with Brussels, a passionate defence of free movement of people and a claim that Britain's future was better in the EU. But the party also wanted to make a case for a new economy - a Green economy - with people and the environment at its heart. This was a morale boosting address - to rally the troops and reassure them the Greens are still relevant. ""Other parties might flirt with changing the economy. Or the welfare system. But we are the only party that is honest about how much things need to change.""He added: ""The Green Party is the party of small business, of creators, givers, sharers and contributors. Of the little guy. The social entrepreneur. The activist. The creative coder and the brave builders. The party for anyone who has a dream. For everyone that wants an economy working for them, not against them.""Also speaking at Harrogate, Ms Lucas said her party had helped ""define the general election story"" by being brave enough not to field candidates in seats where other ""progressive"" parties had a better chance of winning. The tactical alliances were criticised by some party members after Labour and the Lib Dems largely decided not to reciprocate.Ms Lucas said ""progressive votes would continue to be wasted"" until the UK adopted a proportional voting system but, defending her party's choices, she said it had ""lived its values"" by embracing ""pluralistic co-operation"" rather than tribalism.She told activists the Greens would always be ""an insurgent force for good"" that would ""ask the big questions that other parties would not"".On the third day of the party's conference, members backed an idea for a new bank holiday to celebrate the contribution of migrants to British society.

The trial was extended in May for another 12 months, with the Liberal Democrat-led authority claiming the shorter week improved wellbeing and productivity. The Bennett Institute for Public Policy, at the University of Cambridge, was asked to independently review the data, and published its report in April. Conservatives claimed some negative quotes from staff - including a manager saying they ""did all the unfinished work on my day off so that my team could have time off"" - were removed from the report.However, the council said this quote did not include the wider context of what was said by the manager, including that they had learnt to distribute work more responsibly.Steve Hubbard/BBCBridget Smith, Lib Dem leader of the council, said the four-day week was ""about working smarter and becoming more productive""Heather Williams, leader of the Conservative group, said the edited report ""put the emphasis on quantity and not quality of work"".""I think it's no coincidence that the edits that were made removed negative outcomes from the four-day working week,"" she said.""The Lib Dems need to come clean with the reality of this four-day working week. ""It is not giving taxpayers value for money. It's a social experiment that is going to have direct damage for many.""A spokesperson for SCDC said: ""The clarifications suggested on the draft report were for three reasons.""They made some confusing language clearer as the researcher is not a native English speaker; to remove individual member quotes which the council did not have permission to include in the report, and for brevity.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

In Edinburgh, this figure is 97%. This is not a sustainable position, and it will put small businesses, individuals, and councils across Scotland in invidious positions if allowed to continue.""The licensing scheme was designed to tackle problems with housing demand and anti-social behaviour which many claim have been exacerbated by the growth of the short-term let (STL) sector through online platforms such as Airbnb.Edinburgh has already become a ""control zone"" with strict new planning and licensing rules for STLs.But critics of the national legislation say it penalises small business owners and people in private homes who rent out rooms, while leaving multi-national companies exempt.There is also concern that the rules and fees for licensing STLs will vary across Scotland's 32 councils and that operators could face thousands of pounds in charges.Last week, the Scottish Bed and Breakfast Association (SBBA) said two-thirds of Scottish B&B owners were considering shutting their doors over restrictions on short-term lets.Getty ImagesThe SNP's Fergus Ewing is a critic of the Scottish government's schemeSNP MP Fergus Ewing said the new scheme was not needed to tackle anti-social behaviour, as laws already exist which do this. He also said it would do nothing to solve the problem of a lack of affordable housing.""There has never been any proper attempt by the Scottish government to even try to measure the damage these regulations will have on small business and the wider tourism economy,"" he said.""If they don't suspend the regulations now, they will find out the hard way just what a huge blunder these regulations are and forfeit the trust and confidence of many former supporters."".Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said: ""The SNP need to stop acting like they know best and urgently pause their completely unworkable licencing scheme.  ""The industry has repeatedly warned about the devastating effects it will have for many small business owners, but SNP-Green ministers have shamefully refused to address their concerns. ""This refusal to listen makes a mockery of Humza Yousaf's promise to reset his relationship with Scotland's businesses.""Housing Minister Paul McLennan acknowledged the importance of holiday lets to Scotland's tourism industry, and said the licencing scheme would ""give assurance to guests over the safety and consistent quality of lets"".He added: ""We will continue to engage with stakeholders and listen carefully to feedback, but extending the deadline once more will do a disservice to the thousands of operators who have already applied and many others who have prepared their property in order to receive one. ""So the responsible and balanced course of action is for everyone to get behind the task of encouraging and supporting short term let operators to apply for a licence in good time and before the 1 October deadline.""TourismScottish governmentAirbnbHumza Yousaf","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-66655181"

"31 December 2017","Foreign aid to be shifted to support UK policy, Johnson says","Foreign aid to be shifted to support UK policy, Johnson says31 December 2017ShareShareAFPThe UK's aid budget will be shifted to projects that promote its interests, the foreign secretary has said.Boris Johnson said the money will be ""more sensibly distributed"" to support foreign policy aims such as denying safe havens to Islamist militants.His comments came as Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said the UK will provide a £21m boost to an emergency aid fund.The UK currently spends £13bn on aid each year.Speaking to the Times newspaper, Mr Johnson said ""the old jam jars are being smashed"" and money would be diverted to support government aims, including combating terrorist groups in Africa.It would also go to help refugees in Yemen and Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the Burmese border into Bangladesh, he added.Reality Check: How much does the UK spend on overseas aid?Where does UK aid go and why?The government is committed to spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid but some politicians oppose such spending.Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone has said the target ""means that important things at home like social care are struggling,"" while Ukip have called for the aid budget to be cut by 80% and focus only on emergency responses and eradicating disease. Labour backs the 0.7% target, saying global poverty reduction is itself in the UK's interest.In January, the government scrapped plans to fund an Ethiopian girl band as part of a project to promote women's rights. It said there were ""more effective ways"" to invest UK aid.AnalysisBy Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondentFor years there have been calls from some MPs for Britain's foreign aid budget to be cut, and the subject provides a steady stream of headlines in the right-leaning press.Priti Patel said too much of Britain's aid money was wasted, or spent poorly, when she was international development minister.The government recently suspended a £12m aid programme to Syria after a BBC investigation revealed the cash was at risk of going to jihadist groups.And before the 2017 General Election there were suggestions that Theresa May was planning to revise the 0.7% spending target, but eventually it remained unchanged. Mrs May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid while Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP are also committed to keeping the 0.7% target.Mr Johnson's promise to spend foreign aid more wisely may improve confidence, but for the harshest critics it will not go anywhere near far enough.Many will continue to argue that in a time of economic difficulties for the UK, money spent abroad could be used to help tackle health and social care funding problems at home.Mr Johnson said the UK would gain more control of its aid spending after Brexit.About £1bn of the money the UK pays to the EU budget counts as part of the foreign aid budget.The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future.Ms Mordaunt said that the extra £21m for the United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was needed because 2018 could be ""even bleaker"" than this year, with its ""harrowing"" humanitarian crises.The money will hep to provide millions of people with food, clean water, sanitation and vital health services.Where does UK aid go?As of April 2017:More than 40% of the budget went to multilateral organisations, such as the United Nations, who fund big projects like disaster reliefThe remaining 60% goes directly to developing countriesThe Department for International Development says the biggest regional beneficiary is Africa, which received a total of £2.54bn from the UK last yearEthiopia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Syria, were each given more than £200m","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42528712"

Alex Salmond led the SNP for a decade, and as first minister brought Scotland to the brink of independence in 2014. After Scotland voted to stay within the Union, he stood down as leader, but did not stay out of the spotlight for long. He successfully stood in the Gordon constituency in 2015 as the SNP gained all but three Scottish seats. Perhaps the most influential person in recent Scottish political history, he spent 30 years as a parliamentarian.Angus RobertsonMr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSPAngus Robertson had represented Moray at Westminster for 16 years, and was the SNP's leader in the House of Commons. He became one of the party's most high-profile members thanks to the role he played at Prime Minister's Questions. He was often credited for holding Theresa May to account more successfully than Jeremy Corbyn.He was defeated by former MSP Douglas Ross of the Scottish Conservatives who overturned a majority of more than 9,000.John NicolsonJohn Nicolson had been MP for the constituency since 2015Former broadcaster John Nicolson was defeated by Jo Swinson, for the Liberal Democrats. He took the East Dunbartonshire seat from her two years ago. Before becoming a politician in 2015, he was a one-time presenter on BBC Breakfast as well as a reporter on Newsnight and Panorama. He was the SNP's shadow Culture spokesman in the House of Commons.Tasmina Ahmed-SheikhHouse of CommonsTasmina Ahmed-Sheikh previously stood for the Scottish Conservatives.Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh entered parliament in 2015 as an SNP politician, but she had previously stood for the Scottish Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament before briefly having been a member of the Labour Party.

"27 May 2022","Cost of living: Boris Johnson says help with rising bills targeted at poorest","Cost of living: Boris Johnson says help with rising bills targeted at poorest27 May 2022ShareShare1:08The prime minster described the help package as a 'big bazooka'Boris Johnson has said the £15bn package unveiled by the chancellor to help people with soaring energy bills has been targeted at the poorest homes.Labour says some of the money will go to better-off people not in hardship.Speaking in County Durham, the prime minister insisted it would ""overwhelmingly"" support the most vulnerable households.But he said he was ""not going to pretend this is going to fix everything for everybody immediately"".He insisted the measures, which he described as a ""big bazooka"", were ""massively redistributive"", adding that three quarters of those that would benefit would be the most vulnerable.Visiting Stockton-on-Tees, Mr Johnson also said the help was ""much more generous"" than what Labour had proposed, giving £1,200 to eight million households. How will I get the £400 promised for energy bills?What was behind Sunak's mini Budget?How plans to tackle cost of living will affect youIs the government package really worth £37bn?Earlier this week, UK energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by £800 in October, bringing it to £2,800 a year. Bills rose by £700 on average in April.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the £15bn package on Thursday, following weeks of pressure to act from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.Part-funded by a 25% windfall tax on gas and oil company profits, all households will get £400 off their energy bills this October, and there will be further help for those most in need.Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC Breakfast the windfall tax meant the government had ""finally come to their senses"", but asked: ""What took them so long?""The opposition has broadly welcomed the extra help, but says it is poorly targeted, too long in coming, and will funnel extra cash to people who do not need it.Because the money is being paid directly to every household, people who own second or third homes will get multiple £400 payments.But the Treasury said Labour's call for a cut to VAT on fuel  - another of Sir Keir Starmer's key demands - would have benefited better-off households even more. Labour's Rachel Reeves said second home owners should not get extra benefits from the energy bill discountResponding to Labour's criticisms, Mr Sunak said second homes accounted for only ""one or two per cent of the property stock"" across the UK.He suggested that wealthy individuals donate the £400 they will save on bills to charity, adding that he had done so himself.""I'm sure you will join me in giving that money to charity,"" he said on ITV's Good Morning Britain.He called the tax and the cost-of-living help measures ""temporary"". But the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank says calls for assistance are likely to continue for at least another year, with bills expected to keep rising into 2023.Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme if he planned another emergency package next year, even if it meant more government borrowing and higher taxes, the chancellor said: ""I've always been prepared to respond to the situation on the ground"".He added:  ""We will be able to combat and reduce inflation. We have the tools at our disposal and after time it will come down.""Some Conservative MPs have criticised the use of a windfall tax to help fund assistance with bills, with the national debt - pushed higher by furlough and other help during the pandemic - currently standing at around £2.3 trillion.One MP, Richard Drax, accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to socialists"", while another, Craig Mackinlay, described the policy as ""tripe"".But Mr Sunak insisted he remained a ""fiscal conservative"" and wanted to manage the UK's finances ""responsibly"".The Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on people on lower incomes, described the measures as ""a big and well-targeted package"" that would ""offset 82% of the rise in households' energy costs in 2022-23, rising to over 90% for poorer households"". Because higher income households had already seen major tax rises, it added, the overall effect of changes to taxes and benefits this year would be ""highly progressive"".

"8 June 2021","Foreign aid: Rebel Tories blocked in bid to reverse cuts","Foreign aid: Rebel Tories blocked in bid to reverse cuts8 June 2021ShareSharePA MediaA group of Conservative rebel MPs has been thwarted in its bid to overturn £4bn of government cuts to the overseas aid budget.They had suggested returning spending from 0.5% to 0.7% of national income next year through a bill dealing with the UK's new research agency.But the proposal was ruled inadmissible by Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, meaning it will not be put to a vote.However, he called on ministers to give MPs an ""effective"" vote on the issue.Sir Lindsay said the rebels' amendment was not within the remit of the law they wanted to change - meaning it could not be allowed.Despite this, he said ministers should give the Commons ""the respect it deserves"" and find a way to allow MPs an ""effective decision"" on the target.He has granted the rebels a three-hour emergency debate on Tuesday to put their point across - although there will not be a binding vote on their desired changes. Theresa May joins bid to reverse foreign aid cutsCharities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7Foreign aid: What is it used for?A leading rebel, Tory MP Andrew Mitchell, claimed the group would have had enough support to defeat the government if the vote had taken place.He said maintaining the cuts would lead to ""hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths"" in affected countries. He had previously pledged to ""use all the parliamentary procedures we can"" to force a vote on the issue if their amendment was not selected on Monday.The government reduced aid spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income this year, without changing the 2015 law that made the target binding.Ministers have argued this legislation allows the target to be temporarily missed in exceptional circumstances - and says the Covid pandemic counts. But the decision not to give MPs a vote on the issue has angered a number of backbenchers, and led to the threat of legal action. Ministers will be relieved to avoid a vote on the aid cuts, ahead of welcoming world leaders from the G7 group for a summit in Cornwall this weekend.What next for the aid rebels?The failure by MPs to secure a vote on the government's aid cuts does not mark the end of the story.While the rebels may have been stymied by a parliamentary technicality, the Speaker made it very clear he wanted the Commons to having a meaningful vote on the issue soon.And if it did not, then he would ""look at other ways we can move forward"".In the formal language of a parliamentary speaker, this is a threat that if the government does not arrange a vote itself, he may allow the next amendment the rebels table.Their problem, however, is that a legislative opportunity may not now come until the autumn.It means a summer of continuing uncertainty for aid charities, and those they help.As for the government, it has achieved its immediate aim of avoiding what could well have been its first parliamentary defeat.But it still faces another day of criticism for its international aid cuts in the same week it hosts the G7 summit.The government says aid spending will return to the higher 0.7% level ""when the fiscal situation allows"" - but has not specified a date.On Sunday, a group of charities and academics warned ""devastation"" caused by the cuts would lead to families going hungry and girls missing school.The group, including Oxfam and ActionAid UK, also argued it would undermine the UK's international standing and its hosting of the G7.Lee Margaret Webster from ActionAid told the BBC the cuts had forced a project tackling violence against women and girls in Rwanda to close.This included shutting down seven shelters providing sanctuary for girls escaping domestic violence, she said.Earlier, Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said the UK was a big aid donor but added: ""We have a duty to ensure we protect our citizens here as well as those in the rest of the world.""And ex-Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey argued the UK shouldn't ""end up going into deeper debt in order to finance other countries"".Writing in the Telegraph, she said the UK should instead help poorer countries ""trade their way out of poverty"".""If more and more aid was the solution, large parts of Africa would have escaped all poverty decades ago,"" she added.UK Parliament / Jessica TaylorFormer prime minister Theresa May was among the rebels who hoped to defeat the governmentThe rebels had wanted to amend legislation setting up the Advanced Research and Invention Agency - a new body designed to conduct ""high risk"" research.Their amendment would have forced the organisation to make up any shortfall from the 0.7% target from January 2022.Sir Lindsay said he shared the ""frustration"" of MPs about the lack of a vote to date - but after consulting officials, he decided their amendment was outside the scope of the bill, meaning under Commons rules it could not be debated.He added: ""I expect that the government should find a way to have this important matter debated and to allow the House formally to take an effective decision"".Labour - which along with the Lib Dems and SNP supported the amendment - called on ministers to come up with a ""clear timeline"" for reversing the cuts.The party's shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said the ""strength and depth"" of support among MPs for the move was ""clear"".

"8 July 2022","What's happening in Parliament next week?","What's happening in Parliament next week?8 July 2022ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareGetty ImagesEven before the fall of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this looked like a pretty bumpy week in the House of Commons with some difficult legislation due for detailed scrutiny.Now there's a new set of ministers dealing with much of it and a leadership contest under way, with intense scrutiny on candidates declared and undeclared.There will also be a new vibe at Prime Minister's Questions as the newly cleared Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer squares up to continuity PM Boris Johnson, perhaps with some putative successors to the Tory crown trying to muscle in on the action.Labour are planning to put down a motion of no confidence in the government to try to push Mr Johnson out immediately.They argue he should not be performing the normal transition role until a new PM is chosen - a process expected to take several weeks, even if the timings are telescoped a bit. But the motion won't pass unless a fair number of Conservatives support it, which looks unlikely.Windfall taxMonday's main action is the rushing through of all stages of the Energy (Oil and Gas) Profits Levy Bill - also known as the windfall tax. There are already some clues about the kind of amendments opposition MPs might attempt to pass.  The Liberal Democrats want the levy backdated to October 24 2021, the Green MP Caroline Lucas wants the rate set at 30%, and Labour's Dan Carden wants a rate of 55% on above-average profits.PA MediaRail workers went on strike over pay and conditions in JuneAnd watch out too for a spat around the snappily titled: ""Debate on motions relating to the liability of trade unions in proceedings in Tort (Increase of limits on damages) Order, and the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses (Amendment) Regulations"".This may sound very technical, but it's about allowing agency staff to take the place of striking rail workers.Online safetyTuesday's main event will be the first of two days of report stage consideration of the Online Safety Bill (the second day is July 20). The former digital minister Chris Philp, who resigned in the recent convulsions, will not now be batting for the government, after months honing the bill into its current form. His replacement is Matt Warman, a former Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport minister who was in charge of earlier incarnations of the bill, which is just as well because its proposals are so complex and ground-breaking that ministers can't just read themselves into it over a weekend. And when you add in the point that many of the issues and proposed amendments cut across party lines, at a time when Conservative party discipline is weak, there's a very real prospect of amendments being passed in the teeth of government opposition.And there are plenty of them - watch out for Margaret Hodge on making directors of online platforms personally liable for harmful content; she argues that is the most effective way to push them into action. Veteran Tory David Davis is pushing an amendment on ""legal but harmful"" content, and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Chair Julian Knight wants to reduce ministers' power over the codes of conduct, which will designate what is and is not harmful content.That is followed by a debate on the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster, the multi-billion pound revamp of Parliament's Victorian home. Commons Leader Mark Spencer wants to scrap the ""sponsor body"" which was set up to oversee the project on behalf of Parliament. But opponents warn this will further delay already overdue works, and increase the risk of a catastrophic fire or other disaster. PA MediaAn expensive restoration of the Houses of Parliament is under wayIt's not a done deal that the plans will go through on the nod (as House business, they're not supposed to be whipped) and I'm told interest in the issue is rising - as demonstrated by an uptick in MPs asking for a tour of Parliament's basement, which is a pipe-choked, wiring-strewn danger zone. In other times,this might be a more fraught debate, but at the moment I doubt most MPs have the headspace, especially at the fag-end of a torpid Commons Tuesday.NI ProtocolOn Wednesday, the main Commons debate will be on committee consideration of the NI Protocol Bill  (this is the first of three days of detailed debate, which continue on July 18 and 19). Justice Select Committee Chair Sir Bob Neill is proposing a classic Brexit-era amendment to require parliamentary approval for bringing the legislation into force, on the basis that it grants ministers extraordinary powers. The SDLP's Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna want those powers exercised ""only after good faith negotiations with the EU have been exhausted and only with the approval of both Houses of Parliament"". And there's a further amendment on the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly backed by the SDLP, the Lib Dems and the Alliance Party.Educational povertyThursday sees Education Select Committee Chair Robert Halfon deliver a short statement on his committee's latest report - Educational poverty: how children in residential care have been let down and what to do about it. He will have a few minutes to take questions from MPs. Then the main debates are on two subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - the Srebrenica genocide, and protecting and restoring nature at the UN Biodiversity conference, COP15, which opens in China in October.Getty ImagesA debate on the Srebrenica genocide will be held on ThursdayCommons private members bills are back (from 09:30) on Friday, starting with the second reading of SNP's Stuart C McDonald's Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Bill, followed by the Conservative Dean Russell's Employment (Allocation of Tips) Bill.CommitteesThe week's committee action includes Transport calling in RMT leader Mick Lynch to talk about rail strikes and the prospects for negotiations with the train operating companies and Network Rail.

"1 May 2018","Illegal immigration: Are ID cards the answer?","Illegal immigration: Are ID cards the answer?1 May 2018ShareDanny ShawHome affairs correspondent, BBC NewsShareGetty ImagesA sample identity card was unveiled by Labour in 2008Two former Labour home secretaries - Charles Clarke and Alan Johnson - are urging the government to reconsider identity cards.In a joint letter to the Times, the former MPs say that their introduction would prevent a crisis like the Windrush scandal.Meanwhile, former Conservative Home Secretary, Ken Clarke, told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that it was ""impossible"" to control illegal migration without an identity card system.There have been periodic calls for the return of identity cards ever since they were scrapped in the UK in 1952. The most recent - and serious - attempt to bring them back began after the 11 September attacks in the US in 2001, when the Labour government adopted a significantly tougher stance on security and immigration.  This was a period when the threat from terrorism was believed to come primarily from foreign nationals living in Britain, some of whom had multiple aliases and no right to be here. But by the time then Home Secretary David Blunkett published proposals in July 2002, they had been renamed ""entitlement cards"", with the focus on allowing people to access benefits and services. Timeline: ID cardsIdentity cards set to be scrappedIt took another six years before the first cards began to be issued, but by then a powerful civil liberties campaign had the backing of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who scrapped the scheme when they came to power in 2010. It had already cost £300m.  Now, the Windrush crisis, concerns about illegal immigration and the need to register 3.5 million EU nationals who wish to live in Britain after Brexit have led some to conclude that an ID card system should be set up. The prospects, however, are remote. Prime Minister Theresa May was the home secretary who abolished the previous scheme; there's also the cost of setting up and running ID cards (previously estimated at £5bn); and there are some within government who were vehemently opposed last time around and are likely to be so again, such as Brexit Secretary David Davis.And on the Conservative backbenches, Jacob Rees-Mogg told LBC radio that it would be a mistake to introduce ID cards:""If you have ID cards, a policeman can ask you at any time who you are and what you are doing. That's not the British way,"" he said. How common are identity card schemes?The UK is one of only three EU countries that does not issue identity cards to its nationals, the other two are Denmark and the Republic of Ireland.Identity cards are mandatory in 16 countries.While citizens in some countries are not obliged to apply for a national identity card, they are required to hold some other identification document instead.

But Lord Howard said the rules should change or the cabinet should follow Oliver Dowden's example in resigning.The peer said: ""[Mr Johnson's] biggest asset has always been his ability to win votes but I'm afraid yesterday's results make it clear that he no longer has that ability.""The best person in the Conservative Party to judge the mood, both of the party and of the electorate, is its chairman... I think the party, and even more importantly the country, would now be better off under new leadership.""Tory chairman quits after by-election lossesChris Mason: What do by-election defeats mean for PM?Lord Howard said Partygate had revealed an ""unacceptable"" culture that ""came from the top"".He said: ""I think [the by-election defeats] makes clear that my view is shared by very large numbers of people in Yorkshire and Devon - places so different that I think they can reasonably be regarded as representative of the country as a whole.""But, given Mr Johnson wanted to stay on as leader, Mr Howard urged MPs to take matters into their own hands, suggesting frontbenchers consider quitting and backbenchers hold another confidence vote.Senior Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown earlier said there were ""difficult decisions"" to be made.UK ParliamentLord Howard was Conservative leader from 2003 to 2005As treasurer of the backbench 1922 Committee, he would not speculate about a potential rule change, but said he felt his own position was under pressure, despite holding a majority of more than 20,000 votes.""We have seen a very serious and large defeat in two seats in two different areas of the country,"" he said. ""If there were a by-election in my seat tomorrow it would be difficult to hold.""He urged colleagues to ""think very carefully about the future"" about how to ""remedy the situation"" in time for the next election.MPs would have to listen to what Mr Johnson had to say and then ""make a judgement as to whether we think that's a satisfactory explanation or whether we should actually take steps to have a new prime minister"", adding: ""We will have to make some difficult decisions, no doubt.""Earlier this month, 148 Conservative MPs told Mr Johnson they no longer had confidence in him as leader, leaving the prime minister weakened but still in post.The failed challenge was criticised by veteran Tories for being uncoordinated and premature, as now those who want him to go would either need Mr Johnson to resign, or re-write of the rules to allow another vote of confidence.Sir Robert Buckland, MP for South Swindon, told Sky News he had told Boris Johnson personally that he needs to ""look in the mirror and do better"" because the Conservative Party is ""about more than one man"".The former Lord Chancellor admitted it was ""frustrating"" for those on the party's sidelines to see a ""lack of focus"" from the government, but he stopped short of calling for the prime minister's resignation, saying he did not believe ""throwing over the captain now"" would be the right response.But there were more optimistic voices, with one source saying these results were ""priced in"".Deputy PM Dominic Raab said the government needed to be ""relentlessly focused"".He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think we've had distractions because of partygate, because of too much Westminster internal focus when people want to see us focused on their priorities.""He added: ""Yes, we're going to be relentlessly focused on delivery, not allow the distractions of recent times to take our eye off the ball.""And his cabinet colleague, Home Secretary Priti Patel told Times radio that the contests had been fought against a ""difficult and challenging backdrop"".The prime minister's message after these bruising defeats is that there is a job to do to address people's concerns, particularly around the cost of living.The message from him and his team is that ""we will keep going"" - and there are no plans to cut short the prime minister's trips to the Commonwealth conference in Rwanda - or upcoming G7 and Nato summits.But back home, many of his own MPs are desperate for a sign, or message to them, about how he plans to turn things around.For some usual suspects, who have already called for him to go, these votes have solidified their view that he is not the person to lead them into the next general election.But the ones to watch are those who have so far, publicly, been loyal but are now weighing up their options.The Tory MPs in genuinely marginal seats - if a safe one like Tiverton can be turned, where does this leave them?And then there are some government ministers who, privately, have expressed discontent at the prime minister's handling of Partygate, the cost of living, and other policies including Brexit and their Rwanda asylum plan. Do they continue to peg their careers to his fortunes?It'll be tricky for the prime minister to alleviate worries while out of the country all week. But it's a tricky dilemma for him.Come back, and this could signal a sign of panic when he wants to show he's getting on with the job.

She said: ""This cafe, and the volunteers here, are among thousands of organisations and individuals throughout Scotland who do so much for our local communities - not just at Christmas, but all throughout the year. They exemplify the solidarity and compassion which is so important to our society.""I also know that for many people - for example workers in our emergency services, our health service and in our armed forces - Christmas isn't a holiday at all. Your hard work is appreciated all the year round, but is particularly valued at Christmas time.""So over this festive period, let's thank those who are working so hard on our behalf.

On China, she said both sides cannot ignore the threat to their interests, but they must also recognise the country's ""economic significance"" - a clear warning against a lasting US trade war with Beijing.

The health reforms in England in 2012 required local commissioners to put large contracts out to tender. A subsidiary of the US company United Health, along with British firms like Virgin and Circle, is among private groups which has won such contracts. Around 7% of the English health budget goes to private providers. There are different contracting arrangements in other parts of the UK.  The head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, has called for new legislation to drop the requirement for health commissioners to put contracts out to tender.  But if the government decides to do this it's not clear whether that might be overridden by the sort of trade deal with the US mentioned today by Mr Trump. That's the suspicion of those who argue the NHS is vulnerable to covert privatisation. At the end of a day of meetings with the prime minister and a visit to the Churchill War Rooms, Mr Trump welcomed guests for a banquet at the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park.The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended on behalf of the Queen, along with the prime minister and some members of her cabinet.During his visit, the US president is expected to meet Tory leadership hopefuls Michael Gove and Jeremy Hunt.

She told the BBC: ""You can see that on the Russian stock markets, the Russian money markets, the fact that people are having to queue for the bank or the metro station.""Ms Truss added that the West needed to do more on sanctions, particularly around fossil fuel exports to Europe, to ""cut off and cripple"" the Russian economy. Around half of the European Union's gas and one quarter of its oil imports come from Russia.Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel has travelled to Poland to launch a new family scheme for Ukrainian refugees. Under the extended scheme, which was announced earlier this week, British nationals and anyone settled in the UK will be able to apply to bring their parents, grandparents and siblings to the country. The UK's initial visa offer was restricted to immediate family, including children and partners. Will new legal powers find Putin's loot?What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?Is the UK doing enough to help refugees?What sanctions could West still impose on Russia?In Brussels, the foreign secretary has urged her counterparts from Nato, the G7 and EU to ""embrace reliable partners rather than be dependant and beholden on any one country"" for oil or gas.Ms Truss, who described it ""one of the biggest days of diplomacy"", said co-operation between the UK and EU was ""essential to defend European security"".""We will work with fellow freedom-loving democracies to tighten the vice around Putin's war machine and signal our strong support for Ukraine's territorial integrity,"" she added.Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted the war in Ukraine is ""going to plan"", despite taking only one major city - Kherson in the south.Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of ""nuclear terror"" after it bombarded a large nuclear power station, causing a fire. The authorities say the Zaporizhzhya plant - which is the biggest of its kind in Europe - is secure and radiation levels are normal.It comes after President Zelensky asked Mr Putin for one-to-one talks, saying it was the only way to end the war. He has also appealed to Nato to supply warplanes.Russia attacks Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from on the groundTHE BASICS: Why is Putin invading Ukraine?INNER CIRCLE: Who's in Putin's entourage, running the war? UKRAINE: 'I have never felt so much love for my homeland'IN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflictWhile defensive weapons have been sent to Ukraine, the West has largely responded to the invasion with economic sanctions against Russian individuals, businesses and banks.On Thursday the UK announced sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs - Alisher Usmanov, a billionaire whose company previously had links with Arsenal football club - and Igor Shuvalov, a former deputy prime minister to Mr Putin.But there have been calls for swifter clampdowns on oligarchs, with the UK accused of being slower than its European neighbours - claims rejected by Downing Street.There are fears that oligarchs will sell property and move money and assets out of the UK before they are targeted. Ministers have set up a taskforce to look into individual cases. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he would support seizing property in the UK owned by wealthy Russians with links to Mr Putin, as long as the government has ""the evidence and there is the legal basis"" to do so.Mr Raab also confirmed he would support housing Ukrainian refugees in any seized properties, a move called for by the Liberal Democrats. He also said the government is looking at ways to stop lawsuits being used by wealthy individuals to intimidate journalists and organisations looking into sources of their wealth. Mr Raab said wealthy people connected to the Russian president were abusing libel laws to intimidate individuals and organisations highlighting corruption in Russia.Getty ImagesAlisher Usmanov (right) with President Putin at the Kremlin in November 2018Meanwhile on Friday, the home secretary has met Ukrainians applying for the UK's family scheme in Medyka, near the border with Ukraine.Ms Patel said the UK was ""standing in solidarity"" with Ukrainian refugees and the Polish people. During her visit, Ms Patel told reporters that Ukrainians seeking safety in Poland were fleeing ""the most atrocious set of circumstances where they are being persecuted by President Putin"".She said: ""We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine but also with our dear friends here in Poland, who are working really night and day, we can all see this, under incredible circumstances."" Under the scheme, normal requirements for salary or language tests will be waived and checks will be accelerated to process applications as quickly as possible, the Home Office said. It added that ""essential security checks"" would still take place ""given the malign action being taken by the Russian state to infiltrate Ukraine"".It said the family scheme would be followed up by another for Ukrainians with no ties to the UK - with further details to be set out ""in due course""However, Labour called for the creation of a simple emergency visa, valid for 12 months, allowing anyone fleeing the conflict to come to the UK, with normal visa conditions other than biometrics and security checks lifted. More than one million Ukrainians have fled the country since the invasion began last week, according to the United Nations, with most heading for neighbouring countries.

"25 October 2019","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament25 October 2019ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShareUK Parliament/Jessica TaylorIt's going to be a rather strange week in Westminster - with the tone of what follows dictated by the result of the government's latest attempt to trigger a general election. Remember that under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, this requires a two-thirds majority, which is looking difficult to attain.  If it succeeds, both Houses will go into ""washup"" mode, speeding through any essential business, before Parliament is dissolved (dissolution would have to take place on 6 November at the latest, if the election was to be held on 12 December).If, as seems more likely, the vote is not won, the government says it will cease to put Brexit legislation before MPs, even though its Withdrawal Agreement Bill actually achieved a majority of 30 votes. How this will play out is anybody's guess - but in the absence of legislation to enact a Brexit deal, the UK would leave the EU without a deal, when any extended period of membership comes to an end. Which suggests that there will be behind the scenes efforts to find some way out; either an agreement on the timetable for passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, with a deadline acceptable to the government and Labour, or some cunning fix to move to that early election.So why is the timetable issue so important? The Withdrawal Amendment Bill is a major piece of legislation which deals with all manner of vital issues - security cooperation with the EU, the rights of Brits in Europe, the mechanics of the proposed checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and the arrangements for the transition to the as yet un-negotiated long term relationship with the EU, to name but a few. And that's before we get on to possible hostile amendments on a customs union or a referendum, or whatever. And while, for many MPs, scrutiny of the detail of legislation is an empty ritual, during which they sign Christmas cards or answer letters, rather than engaging with the process, others will detect problems which might be critical to their constituents and local interests. Ram the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the Commons in 36 hours, runs the argument, and there would be little chance to address them, while a more leisurely process could head off any number of problems once the Bill becomes law.But don't ignore the raw electoral strategy that lurks millimetres below the surface of this argument. The Conservatives are seeking to frame the Brexit battle as ""the people versus Parliament"". But plenty of Labour MPs say they're simply not prepared to vote for an election at a time and on the ground of the prime minister's choosing. They want the Conservatives to go into an election with their Brexit Party flank unsecured, and with their internal divisions over Brexit festering visibly. Will the government go on 'strike'?For the SNP and the Lib Dems the considerations are a little different - both want to stop Brexit, but now calculate that there are not enough votes in this Parliament to get a second referendum, and both believe they would win more seats, so increasingly feel they have nothing to lose - although again they are wary of letting the PM control the timing and context of any election.Meanwhile, for all the talk of the government going ""on strike"" there is a fair wodge of (mostly rather humdrum) legislation landing in the Lords and the Commons this week, and the select committees are beavering away at their inquiries, conscious that the music might stop and an election might be called at any moment.And there's an election for Speaker rumbling in the background, with MPs due to vote a week on Monday. PA MediaJohn Mann is standing down as an MP to head a government inquiry into anti-SemitismIncidentally, one amusing sub-plot will be the departure from the Commons (probably on Tuesday, I hear), and immediate arrival in the Lords, of the Labour MP, John Mann. He is leaving the Commons to lead the government's campaign against anti-Semitism, and plans to allow himself to be disqualified as an MP by the act of becoming a peer, rather than taking the more usual route of applying for an office of profit under the Crown, like the Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead (MPs can't simply resign, under rules dating back before the Civil War; they have to self-disqualify). A writ for a by-election has to be moved as a motion, usually without notice in the House at the very beginning of proceedings before Question Time and there's a very strong tradition that the moving is done only by the chief whip of the party which held the seat at the point the vacancy occurred. Mr Mann's Bassetlaw seat is precisely the kind of pro-Brexit blue collar seat the Conservatives will be targeting at the next election, so a by-election there (if not overtaken by an early general election) would be quite an event. Here is my regular look at the week ahead in Parliament:Monday 28th OctoberThe Commons opens (14:30) with Home Office questions - look out for Labour MP Sarah Champion, who is campaigning to change the law so that it is a criminal offence to marry children under age 18. At the moment  16-17-year-olds may marry with parental consent, but she is concerned that, often, the children (mainly girls) getting married at this age are pressured into marrying older men -   it requires the child to recognise the marriage is coerced for it to count as a forced marriage.Getty ImagesMPs are concerned about pressure on young women to marry older menAfter Question Time (and assuming no post-weekend statements or Urgent Questions intrude), the prime minister will make his third attempt to trigger an early general election. Under the Cameron-Clegg Fixed Term Parliaments Act, two thirds of MPs (and we're talking about the total number, 650, not the number present at a particular vote, and including the non-attending Sinn Fein MPs and the Speaker and deputies) which means 434 MPs have to vote for the election. In practice, this means that even were the SNP and the Lib Dems to support the motion, around 80 Labour MPs would also have to join the Conservatives in the Aye Lobby. And it is clear that even if Labour were to whip in favour of an election, many Labour MPs are still minded to vote against - essentially on the turkeys-early Christmas principle. The government knows these numbers, and so they may be staging this vote as a piece of parliamentary theatre, to demonstrate that it is the Commons that is preventing the on-schedule delivery of Brexit. Look out for some combative exchanges on points of order, after the result is announced.  There had been talk of the government ""going on strike"" and refusing to put legislation before Parliament if the vote is lost - but the Prime Minister's Official Spokesman now says that only Brexit legislation will be held back, and efforts to pursue a ""dynamic and ambitious"" domestic agenda ""with full vigour"" will continue.The day's main debate will be on the Second Reading of the Environment Bill - a major 130-clause piece of legislation, setting up an Office for Environmental Protection, with scrutiny, advice and enforcement functions and allowing the government to set long-term, legally binding environmental targets on air quality, water, biodiversity, resource efficiency and waste reduction.MPs are due to debate re-wilding and bioderversityIn Westminster Hall (16:30) MPs debate e-petition 254607: ""Restore nature on a massive scale to help stop climate breakdown..... to avoid a climate emergency we need to act fast. Rewilding and other natural climate solutions can draw millions of tonnes of CO2 out of the air through restoring and protecting our living systems. We call on the UK government to make a bold financial and political commitment to nature's recovery.""The petition attracted 109,077 signatures.My committee corridor pick is a session of the high powered joint committee on the National Security Strategy (16:15) on Biosecurity and human health: preparing for emerging infectious diseases and bioweapons. The key witness is Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England. Elsewhere, look out for the Public Accounts session (16:00) on food safety and standards, with officials from the Food Standards Agency and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, and Housing, Communities and Local Government has its first encounter with the new Secretary of State, Robert Jenrick. In the Lords (14:30), the day opens with the introduction of two new peers - Lord Hendy QC, a barrister specialising in employment law, who will sit as a Labour peer, and Baroness Hunt of Bethnal Green, the former Chief Executive of Stonewall, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans equality charity . She will sit as a Crossbench peer.Questions to ministers include the Conservative, Lady Gardner of Parkes, asking about regulating websites like AirBnb and assessing their impact on the availability of housing for rent. There will be a short debate on vocational education and training in secondary schools - and then peers move on to the Second Reading of the Historical Institutional Abuse (Northern Ireland) Bill, which establishes the Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Board and provides for compensation for children abused in certain institutions. It also creates a Commissioner for Survivors of Institutional Childhood Abuse.Tuesday 29th OctoberMPs open (11:30) with Health and Social Care Questions, The main debate is a re-run of the Second Reading of the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill - this had a second reading in July, and had strong cross-party support, but fell when Parliament was prorogued. Its aim is to provide a greater deterrent to animal cruelty by extending the maximum sentence possible, from six months to five years in England and Wales. In Westminster Hall, subjects for debate include the proposed reinstatement of the Colne to Skipton railway link (09:30); the funding of Liverpool City Council (11:00); Endometriosis workplace support (14:30); bus services in Cumbria (16:00) and government support for economy and innovation in Northern Ireland (16:30).It's a busy day on the committee corridor, with Health and Social Care (14:30) quizzing a high powered panel of expert witnesses in their follow-up inquiry on Childhood obesity, and then three ministers, Nigel Adams, Minister for Sport, Jo Churchill, Health Minister for Prevention, and Luke Hall, Minister for Local Government and Homelessness. Foreign Affairs looks at the future of Britain's diplomatic relationship with Europe (14:45);Environmental Audit meets the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Theresa Villiers (14:15); International Development taking evidence from Africa Minister Andrew Stephenson on humanitarian crises in Africa (13:30) and Defence will be hearing from experts and the Police about the domestic threat of drones (14:00); In the Lords (14:30) the day opens with the introduction of Lord Ranger, Raminder Singh Ranger, a refugee from the 1947 partition of India, who became the chairman of the British Sikh Association and joint chairman of the Conservative Friends of India.The main business is the Second Reading debate on the Health Service Safety Investigations Bill which will establish a new independent Health Service Safety Investigations Body. Health minister Baroness Blackwood of North Oxford leads for the government.Wednesday 30th OctoberThe Commons begins (11:30) with half an hour of Northern Ireland Questions, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time - the last to be presided over by John Bercow - will he stretch it over the one-hour mark?That will be followed by a general debate on Grenfell Tower.  In Westminster Hall the debates include: building out extant planning permissions (09:30); integrated foreign policy after the UK leaves the EU (11:00); child poverty in Scotland (14:30); bus passes for 1950s women (16:00) and the contribution of the Gujarati community to the UK (16:30)Once again there's plenty of select committee activity. The Treasury committee, under new management with former Treasury Minister Mel Stride now in the chair, has a session on regional imbalances in the UK economy (14:15). Northern Ireland Affairs takes evidence on consultation on implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, (09:30); Work and Pensions focuses on the new Pension Schemes Bill (09:30). And Women and Equalities (09.50) has its first evidence session on its inquiry into prostitution, with Criminology Professor Teela Sanders, Lynette Woodrow, the deputy chief Crown prosecutor for London South, and Prof Marianne Hester, who holds the chair in gender, violence and international policy, at the University of Bristol. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (10:00) has a follow-up session on the rolling out of smart meters.In the Lords (15:00) the main business is the Second Reading of the Pension Schemes Bill, which has cross-party support and deals with protecting Collective Defined Contribution schemes. These schemes exist in other countries, notably the Netherlands, but are new to the UK. Major supporters have been the Royal Mail and the Communication Workers Union and there has been considerable cross party discussion, involving Labour's Jack Dromey.. The Bill also creates new criminal offences and financial penalties, gives the Pensions Regulator more powers, intended to prevent more BHS-type problems and will aim for closer supervision and larger penalties. It also sets up the proposed Pensions Dashboard system. Thursday 31st October UK Parliament/Jessica TaylorJohn Bercow retires from the Speaker's chair on ThursdayThe Commons day opens (09:30) with 40 minutes of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Questions, followed by mini-question times to the MPs who speak on behalf of the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission.And the Leader of the House, Jacob Rees Mogg. will make the weekly business statement, setting out the forthcoming agenda for the Commons. Because this will be Speaker Bercow's last day in the chair, there will probably be some tributes - maybe rather barbed ones in some cases, and there will then be an opportunity for tributes to the Speaker's Chaplain Rose Hudson Wilkin, who is leaving to become Bishop of Dover. The main debate will be a general debate on spending on children's services. In the Lords (11:00), questions to ministers includes Labour's Lord Dubs asking about the Demands of Extinction Rebellion.The main debates are on the Phase 1 report of the Grenfell Tower Inquiry and then on the government's international development work to promote the sustainable use of natural resources and prevent biodiversity loss.Neither House is scheduled to sit on Friday, 1 November.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-50181490"
"4 November 2022","I live rent free in Rishi Sunak's head, says Jeremy Corbyn","I live rent free in Rishi Sunak's head, says Jeremy Corbyn4 November 2022ShareShareHoCFormer Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joked that he now ""lives rent free"" in Rishi Sunak's head because the prime minister mentions his name so often.Mr Sunak has repeatedly attacked current Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer over his support for Mr Corbyn at the last general election.In his latest jibe, at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak claimed Mr Corbyn had wanted to abolish the army.Mr Corbyn accused the PM of creating a ""wholly inaccurate representation"".Jeremy Corbyn on Political Thinking with Nick RobinsonWhy was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour?Since Mr Sunak took over as prime minister last week, the Conservative Party has frequently linked Sir Keir to Mr Corbyn, despite Sir Keir expelling Mr Corbyn from the Parliamentary Labour Party in a long-running row over anti-Semitism.In an email to Conservative supporters earlier this week, Mr Sunak said: ""Jeremy Corbyn might be gone, but Labour is still led by the man who tried to make Corbyn Prime Minister. And nothing has changed."" At PMQs, Mr Sunak hit back at Sir Keir's claims his government had lost control of the asylum system, by saying: ""This is the person who, in 2019, told the BBC - I do think Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister'. ""Let us remember that national security agenda: abolishing our armed forces, scrapping the nuclear deterrent, withdrawing from NATO, voting against every single anti-terror law we tried, and befriending Hamas and Hezbollah. He may want to forget about it, but we will remind him of it every week, because it is the Conservative government who will keep this country safe.""Mr Corbyn - who now sits as an independent MP - raised a point of order in the House of Commons on Thursday, accusing the PM of giving ""a wholly inaccurate representation of the 2019 election manifesto of which he must've been fully aware"". ""If I am going to live rent free in his head at least he could accurately reflect what I think and what I say rather than inventions made up by him or his office."", he added. He also accused Mr Sunak of breaking the convention whereby MPs inform other MPs if they are going to mention them in the Commons. 1:19Rishi Sunak is questioned about the actions of his home secretary at his second session as prime minister.Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said the former Labour leader should get used to being mentioned by the PM on a weekly basis.She added that if he wanted to ""correct the record"" he could ""publish the manifesto that he stood on which would have weakened this country and dismantled Nato"".Mr Corbyn hit back saying Labour's 2019 manifesto was ""freely available"" and added: ""If it had resulted in a Labour government we would not have such poverty, such food banks, such misery in this country today.""Prior to becoming Labour leader Mr Corbyn had called for Nato to be disbanded however the party's 2019 manifesto promised to ""maintain our commitment"" to the organisation. It also supported the renewal of Britain's nuclear weapons system - despite Mr Corbyn's long-standing opposition to nuclear weapons - and pledged to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence to ""guarantee that our armed forces are versatile"". Sir Keir was shadow Brexit secretary under Mr Corbyn, who led the Labour Party to two general election defeats, in 2017 and 2019.Mr Corbyn was suspended from the party in October 2020 over his reaction to a highly critical report about anti-Semitism in the party under his leadership.Penny MordauntRishi SunakJeremy Corbyn","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63503486"

They can't be bothered, don't want to know - they think if they vote they won't be heard.""Pauline French has volunteered in the community for 36 yearsMarfleet Lane is the main shopping street in the area and has a mix of charity shops, takeaways and betting shops.The ward is also home to rugby league team Hull Kingston Rovers and there is a fierce rivalry between the red and white supporters of Rovers and the black and white fans of Hull FC to the west.It is one of the most deprived wards in the city and in January just under 12% of the working age population were claiming unemployment benefit, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.According to the 2011 census, 95% of residents described themselves as white BritishPauline said the lack of engagement in the political process goes both ways.""We don't see any candidates, there's no canvassing, if you get the leaflet pushed through then there's a lot of people that can't read, they look at it and throw it away,"" she says.""So they don't know really what we have to vote for and they just aren't interested."" Janet Goforth lives on the Greatfield estate and volunteers at St Philips community food bank.""I grew up here, had my family here...people stay in the area,"" she says.One of her main concerns is a lack of investment in activities for children.""There's nothing for the older ones to do,"" she explains. ""They need opportunities to improve their self-esteem, they need their confidence building up.""The majority of homes in the area are terraced and just over half of them are social housingSo will people living in Marfleet be voting this time or not?

There is a clear pattern to suggest people in more deprived areas are less likely to vote, especially in council elections.The reason, according to political expert Professor John Curtice, is that many think ""general elections matter and local elections do not"". Some feel it is their democratic responsibility to turnout every four or five years to elect a government. But that same sense of duty is not always felt when it comes to choosing a councillor.Low turnout is often attributed to apathy and a sense that putting a cross in a box changes nothing. Yet many have strong views about the services delivered by local councils, such as education, social care, planning and local transport. The challenge for election candidates is to convince more people that using their vote could make a real difference to place where they live. 'Not clued up'Thomas Oates said he has no interest in the local electionsSchool caretaker Thomas Oates said he would not be voting. ""It doesn't interest me, never has,"" the 33-year-old said.He said he had voted in the past, but ""with all that's going on I am just not interested"".""Nothing really puts me off, you hear one thing and then you hear another thing.""He could not explain why so many people in the area shared his view and opted not to vote.""It's personal preference whether they do or they don't.""Not a lot of people are clued up on it all.""'Too lazy'John Clint puts the low turnout to people being ""lazy""John Clint, 82, will be going to the polling booth.""I think everybody has to vote, it's one way of putting our views forward,"" the retired postal worker said.He said he would not like to say why the majority of people living in Marfleet did not vote.""Maybe we are all getting a bit too lazy to do this sort of thing nowadays,"" he said.""A couldn't-care-less attitude.""'No interest'Pauline Ostler cannot remember the last time she votedPauline Ostler said she doubted she would vote on 6 May.The 81-year-old said she could not remember the last time she had cast her ballot.""I wouldn't know who to vote for.

Sammy's Point was chosen in 2015 by the then Labour-run authority as the  location for the riverside berth due to its proximity to the city centre.The attraction opposed the plan, saying its marine life would be affected by noise, pollution and vibrations.Labour leader Daren Hale described the cancellation as ""ludicrous"".

"27 July 2023","82% of burglaries unsolved by Met Police, Home Office data shows","82% of burglaries unsolved by Met Police, Home Office data shows27 July 2023ShareYasmin RufoBBC NewsShareGetty ImagesThe best-performing police force was Cumbria, where only 60% of burglaries go unsolvedFigures reveal 82% of burglaries went unsolved by the Metropolitan Police in London across the 2022/2023 financial year, according to the Home Office.Data shows 47,050 burglaries in London were closed without a suspect being identified. This makes the Met the third worst-performing police force in the country after South Yorkshire and Hampshire, where 84% and 83% go unsolved.A Met spokesperson said: ""Officers are attending 9 out of 10 burglaries.""When asked about the rate of unsolved burglaries, they said: ""The latest figures (1 April to 4 June) show there were 6,470 reported residential burglaries in London. Of these, officers attended 6,070 of the crimes. This is 94%."" Across England and Wales, nearly 77% of all burglaries went unsolved in that same time period, and an average of 6% of burglary cases resulted in a suspect being charged or summoned.In 2022, the Met Police said it would attend all reports of burglary in London.Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said it was unacceptable that, at the time, the proportion of reported burglaries attended by an officer from the force had fallen to 50%.PA MediaSir Mark Rowley said the Met's low attendance record for burglary was ""unacceptable""The Liberal Democrats, who analysed the data, called for a return to ""proper community policing"" and a new ""Burglary Response Guarantee"" under which all domestic burglaries would be attended by the police and properly investigated.They said that since 2015, the Conservatives had taken more than 4,000 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) off the streets and, as of last year, just 12% of officers across England and Wales were assigned to frontline neighbourhood policing teams.The Labour Party accused the Conservatives of ""running down"" the police service.Shadow home office minister Sarah Jones MP said Labour's next government would ""bring back proper neighbourhood policing"" by recruiting 13,000 more neighbourhood police and PCSOs.A Home Office spokesperson said neighbourhood crimes including burglary, robbery and theft were down 51% since 2010.""The Home Secretary does expect to see forces getting the basics right,"" they said. ""That's why she called for every force to send an officer to investigate the scene of every home burglary, which is now happening across the country.""They added the Home Office had ""invested record funding into policing"" that can be used for neighbourhood patrols, CCTV and alarm systems. 'Getting off scot-free'Liberal Democrat MP for Richmond Park, Sarah Olney said: ""Everyone deserves to feel safe and secure in their own homes, but so many burglars are getting off scot-free. ""These figures will bring little comfort to families and pensioners in London. ""The Conservatives must finally bring back proper community policing and back the Liberal Democrats' Burglary Response Guarantee so all burglaries are attended by the police. ""It's the only way to reverse these shocking figures.""A spokesperson for the Met added the force had issued ""480 video doorbell devices to vulnerable and repeat victims across London"" in order to provide ""some reassurance and added security"".In a further crackdown on burglaries, the Met said: ""Throughout the summer, a manhunt team is also dedicated solely to proactively identifying and arresting suspected prolific burglars.

"20 October 2017","Week ahead in Parliament","Week ahead in Parliament20 October 2017ShareMark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondentShare1:06The Speaker told the government, following the latest Opposition Day vote: Don't pretend you didn't loseStill no sign of the eagerly-anticipated Commons committee of the whole House debates on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill - the mission-critical Brexit measure previously known as the Great Repeal Bill.  Westminster rumour suggests the planned eight committee-stage days will not begin until after the November half-term (although an alternative rumour suggests maybe one committee day will be scheduled to allow the government whips to test the waters) and that MPs will then have to yomp through two or three days a week of detailed debate, until the bill is done.There's plenty to chew on, with the latest amendment paper running to 146 pages, covering more than 300 amendments and 50 new clauses - and the longer the delay, the more new proposals to rewrite this crucial bill arrive. And the delay also allows MPs, particularly ""soft Brexit"" supporters to examine rival amendments and condense around the ones which command the widest support.  While all that goes on, offstage, the timetable for Commons Chamber is devoted to a mix of uncontroversial technical legislation (Smart Meters and Self-Drive Cars this week), backbench debates and Opposition debates. Opposition debates highlightedAnd the government's controversial tactic of declining to vote in the latter continues to make waves.Twice - first on student loans and now on Universal Credit - the Opposition have ""won"" votes and twice ministers have brushed their victories aside as ineffectual, or ""non-binding""; so now the Opposition parties have set out on a quest to find the holy grail of Commons procedure - a way to make Opposition Day motions bite on the government.This timeless quest takes them deep into the wilds of parliamentary procedure - territory normally only navigated by the most experienced clerks. Once upon a time the Opposition parties claimed a share of ""supply days"", but in the early 1980s this was changed to ""Opposition Days"". This was more than a cosmetic change. The clue is the word ""supply"", which is the Commons jargon term for issues dealing with the allocation of public money. On Supply Days motions to move money around had actual effect; mere Opposition Days do not provide the same procedural cover. This is why motions passed on Opposition Days can now be dismissed as purely symbolic. And still smarting from their double rebuff, the Labour, SNP and Lib Dems' procedural wonks are poring through dusty tomes of Commons rules to find a way to give an Opposition Day motion actual effect.One time-honoured manoeuvre, last attempted in the 1970s, is a motion to dock a minister's pay, as punishment for some offence. But that would have been debated on a Supply Day and no-one really knows if it would have effect if pressed to a vote and then won, on a mere Opposition Day. But there are mutterings about attempting this move against the Commons Leader, Andrea Leadsom, in punishment for her failing to treat those Opposition Day motions as binding.The nearest modern analogue to Supply Days are the Estimates Days, when the Commons is asked to approve government spending plans, having debated the contents of assorted select committee reports (I know this sounds a bit bizarre - it is...) rather than the actual Estimates themselves.  The subjects for debate on these days are chosen by the Commons Liaison Committee, the super-committee of all the main select committee chairs. It is quite difficult to imagine this body allowing such a motion to go forward, not least because it will have a Conservative Chair and a Conservative majority when it is finally set up.Meanwhile, the Work and Pensions Committee, and more particularly its formidable Chair, Frank Field, have their jaws firmly locked around the ankle of Secretary of State David Gauke - and given Mr Speaker's expressed discontent with the government's response to this week's Universal Credit vote, I suspect he has an excellent chance of triggering another full Commons debate on the issue, sooner rather than later.Anyway here's my rundown of the week ahead: The Commons opens (2.30 pm) with Defence questions - and, as ever, any post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will follow at 3.30pm. This includes a report back by the prime minister on the latest EU summit. The day's main legislating is on the second reading of the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill, which would require motorway services and petrol stations to install chargers for electric cars and sets out how driverless cars will be registered and how liability for accidents will be decided. The bill reprises the proposals in the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill, which was abandoned earlier this year, because of the general election. There's a Westminster Hall debate at 4.30 pm on e-petition 186565 relating to eligibility for mortgages - which calls for a record of paying rent on time to be recognized as evidence that mortgage re-payments can be met. It has attracted 147,307 signatures.My select committee pick is the Public Accounts hearing on mental health in prisons (4pm) with officials from the NHS and the Prison Service.In the Lords (2.30 pm) question time covers consumer and personal debt in the UK, the life science industrial strategy, serious offences committed by members of the armed forces; and banks and building societies undertaking comprehensive immigration checks.  Then, peers turn to their third day of detailed debate on the Space Industry Bill - which creates a new regulatory framework for UK based spaceflight activities, including the operation of UK-based spaceports. Today's debate will focus on the sections dealing with offences, civil sanctions and appeals. The dinner break business is a short debate on Science, Innovation and the government's industrial strategy.The Commons kicks off (11.30 am) with Treasury questions. More Urgent Questions or ministerial statements may follow.The main debate is on the second reading of the Smart Meters Bill, which will regulate the rollout of smart meters and ensure consumers are protected in the unlikely event that the company running the national smart meters communications infrastructure - the Smart Data and Communications Company - were to become insolvent. There are almost 7.7 million smart meters operating in the UK, with nearly 350,000 being installed every month.The adjournment debate on preparedness to leave the EU with no agreement, is led by Dover MP Charlie Elphicke - expect the issue of border controls and managing lorries heading for Channel crossings to feature.The opening Westminster Hall debate - chosen by the Backbench Business Committee - is on UK relations with Taiwan (9.30am). The debate will be led by the Conservative, Bob Blackman. This follows a visit to Taiwan by the All Party Parliamentary Group, where the subject of a possible post-Brexit free trade deal was raised ""by their ministers as well as by us"", Mr Blackman told me. The snag is Taiwan's ambiguous status, with the People's Republic of China regarding it as a rebel province - and that would certainly complicate any potential deal. Watch for some carefully-phrased responses from the government. In Westminster Hall, debates include: improving rail links in South West England (2.30pm); local authority funerals (4pm) and English language teaching for refugees (4.30pm). There was an errorThis content is not available in your location.Baroness Trumpington startles Lord King during a debate in 2011On the committee corridor, the Digital, Cultural Media and Sport Committee has a hearing (10.30am) with the Chief Executive of Channel 4, David Abraham - covering the channel's possible relocation away from London and, possibly, their swoop to take the Great British Bake-Off. In the Lords (from 2.30 pm) it's the last day for one of the real characters of the Upper House, the Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington, who retires at the age of 94. The oldest female peer, Baroness Trumpington was ennobled in 1980 and served in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, having also worked as a code breaker at Bletchley Park during World War II and served as mayor of Cambridge. Questions to ministers cover the penalties and custodial sentences for animal welfare offences in England, and discussions with the devolved administrations on Brexit. But perhaps the most politically sensitive is the one from Lib Dem election guru Lord Rennard on the proposal to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600, and the associated review of Commons constituency boundaries. This reprises an ongoing argument from the Coalition years, when the Lib Dems blocked the 2013 Boundary Review process. This proved to be a good move in party terms at least, because on the proposed new boundaries they would have won perhaps three or four seats, rather than eight in 2015….. Lord Rennard will be following up reports in the Times that due to backbench Conservative pressure, the process would be dropped. Then, there's some quite interesting action behind the scenes as peers move into the first day of detailed report stage scrutiny of the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill. The Lib Dem peer Lord Sharkey, and others, are trying to get a ""breathing space"" amendment giving people in deep financial trouble a moratorium on debt collection to allow them a chance to recover. The snag is that it's out of the scope of the bill, so it would not normally be in order. For that reason there is an attempt to persuade the government to put down its own out of scope amendment, something for which there is precedent.  Other amendments attempt to ban cold calling by debt management companies and to require compulsory advice, before people can draw money down their pension pots. Peers will also debate an order under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to make Methiopropamine ('MPA'), a synthetic drug similar to Amphetamine, a Class B drug.MPs' day begins (11.30 am) with half an hour of Scottish questions, with Prime Minister's Questions following, at noon. That is followed by two Labour Opposition Day motions - on Social Care, and then on Supported Housing. The latter is housing for groups like elderly or disabled people, and also includes women's refuges. Labour's shadow housing minister, John Healey, was unconvinced by the government response to concerns about changes to the way it is funded, when the issue was debated in Westminster Hall recently. In Westminster Hall, debates cover police funding in London (9.30am); economic and environmental impacts of airport expansion (11am); the centenary of the Balfour declaration (2.30pm); and Operation Stack and lorry parking in Kent (4pm).PALorries queued as part of Operation Stack along the north and southbound carriageways of the M20 in Ashford, Kent in 2015Folkestone MP Damian Collins told me the lorry park for Channel traffic is a big Kent issue, and a big Brexit issue, and that he wants assurances on resilience, if there are delays at Channel crossings, so he will be looking for a progress report from the minister. Finally, there's a debate on the National Railway Museum and ownership of national assets (4.30pm).On the committee corridor, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee has two evidence sessions on allegations of regulatory breaches at the chicken processor, 2 Sisters Food Group, the UK's largest supplier of supermarket chicken. This follows undercover filming which led to claims of poor hygiene standards and altered food safety records. The chief executive Ranjit Singh; the Food Standards Agency; Assured Food Standards and The British Poultry Council give evidence.Elsewhere, Brexit Secretary David Davis (9.15am), Education Secretary Justine Greening (10.15am), Justice Secretary David Lidington (10am) and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (2.30pm) are all before their respective select committees. In the Lords (3pm) questions cover: official announcements relating to terrorism focussing on perpetrator's creed rather than their crime; protecting members of the armed forces from repeated inquiries into the same incident, and the register of hereditary peers who wish to stand for election to the House of Lords The peers move onto the third reading of the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Bill - which will probably be no more than a brief rubber stamping Next up is report stage consideration of the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing Bill - the key issue is consumer protection. This is followed by the second reading of the EU (Approvals) Bill - where the points for discussion include the EU-Canada trade agreement and observer status for Albania and Serbia in the work of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights. The Commons opens (9.30am) with 40 minutes of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions, followed by mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission (the administrative body of the Commons), the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. Then comes Commons Business Questions with the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.The main debates are on two subjects chosen by the Backbench Business Committee; on the implementation of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and on Global LGBT rights.In Westminster Hall, there's a debate on International Freedom of Religion or Belief Day.UK ParliamentSteve Baker is one of the Brexit ministers giving evidence to the select committee this weekOn the committee corridor, Brexit Ministers Steve Baker and Robin Walker give evidence to the Brexit Select Committee (1pm) on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill.In the Lords (11am) ministers take questions on winter staffing levels in the NHS, security co-ordination between the UK and its allies, and the sustainability of funding for police forces in England and Wales. The main debates are on subjects nominated by Lib Dem peers, on intergenerational fairness and government policy; and on the impact of air and water pollution on the environment and public health. There's also a short debate on supporting the Rohingya refugees currently displaced in Bangladesh.The Commons isn't sitting, but the Lords are in town (from 10am) to consider private members' bills.First comes the Asset Freezing (Compensation) Bill - this is a second attempt to get this through from the UUP's Lord Empey, after his first try was scuppered by the general election.The issue is the support, between the early 1970s and the 1990s, provided by Colonel Gaddafi's regime in Libya to the Provisional IRA. This included arms, ammunition, financing, military training and explosives, such as semtex, to conduct terrorist attacks in Britain. For a number of years, the victims of those attacks have been seeking compensation from the Libyan authorities. And they have sought to extract compensation using the almost £9.5bn of Gaddafi regime assets frozen in the UK following the 2011 uprising. Lord Empey's bill seeks to use these frozen assets to compensate the victims. One of the key issues here is that US citizens, including people injured in attacks in the UK, like the IRA's 1983 Harrods bombing, have been compensated by Libya, after action in the US courts. The government has raised a number of international law objections based on UN Security Council resolutions and EU regulations, but since the previous incarnation of this bill was passed by the Lords, the same outcome seems likely this time - and ministers will then come under pressure to find time to get it through the Commons as well.Next the Conservative peer Lord Holmes of Richmond has the second reading debate for his Unpaid Work Experience (Prohibition) Bill which seeks to ban unpaid work experience exceeding four weeks. Finally, there's the Democratic Political Activity (Funding and Expenditure) Bill proposed by the Lib Dem, Lord Tyler.  He says this will provide an opportunity to seek urgent agreement on control of election campaign funding and expenditure, before another general election....or indeed another referendum.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-41693097"

""This paper published today sets out how, with independence, we could help ensure that success with a migration system specifically tailored to Scotland's needs, to make it easier for more people to settle and integrate here.""She said Scotland's population was set to fall, unlike other UK nations, under current constitutional arrangements.

She said he had then been driven for 10 hours to a detention centre in the London area. Ms McLaughin also claimed that Mr Salimi had been given ""no food or water"" on the journey, had his phone confiscated and was without legal representation. The Glasgow North East MP told the Commons: ""I am his MP. I have the right to know what's going on in his life and the right to represent him.""What is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Why a plane to Rwanda won’t be taking off anytime soonThe Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said it was ""entirely right and proper that people are detained on a legal basis for the purposes of removal under this policy"".He added: ""There are always safeguards around that. We will of course in the normal way look very carefully at any concerns she wishes to raise.""I recognise that she is entirely opposed to the policy objective that we're seeking to advance - there is a principle disagreement there.""But on those specific points if she'd like to share them with me I will gladly ensure she receives a full response.""It came as the government confirmed that migrants identified for deportation to Rwanda have started to be detained in a series of operations across the UK.The policy seeks to deter people from crossing the English Channel from France in small boats.The Home Office has not said how many people have been detained, but more operations are due to be carried out in the coming weeks. The announcement came the day before people in England go to the polls in local elections.Legislation aimed at reviving the plan to send some asylum seekers to the east African country was passed into law last week.The government says any asylum seeker entering the UK ""illegally"" after 1 January 2022, from a safe country such as France, could be sent to Rwanda.They would have their asylum claims processed there, rather in than the UK.If successful, they could be granted refugee status and allowed to stay in the landlocked east-central African country.If not, they could apply to settle in Rwanda on other grounds, or seek asylum in another ""safe third country"".No asylum seeker would be able to apply to return to the UK.Anne McLaughlinMs McLaughlin raised Mr Salimi's case in the House of CommonsThe government had previously said it was aiming for flights to Rwanda to take off by the spring but now says this should happen in nine to 11 weeks - although the plan could still be held up by legal challenges. After the Supreme Court ruled that the scheme was unlawful in November of last year, the UK government introduced a bill stating that Rwanda is a safe country.The legislation - which was finally approved on 22 April after intense political wrangling - orders the courts to ignore key sections of the Human Rights Act.It also compels the courts to disregard other British laws or international rules - such as the international Refugee Convention - which would block deportations to Rwanda.The Supreme Court had ruled unanimously that the Rwanda scheme was unlawful, with judges raising concerns that genuine refugees would be at risk of being returned to their home countries, where they could face harm.The ruling also cited concerns about Rwanda's poor human-rights record and its past treatment of refugees, with judges also saying that the UK government has previously Rwanda over ""extrajudicial killings, deaths in custody, enforced disappearances and torture"".Responding to the initial detentions, Home Secretary James Cleverly said: ""Our dedicated enforcement teams are working at pace to swiftly detain those who have no right to be here so we can get flights off the ground.""Home Office director of enforcement Eddy Montgomery said teams were trained to ensure detentions were carried out safely.He added: ""It is vital that operational detail is kept to a minimum, to protect colleagues involved and those being detained, as well as ensuring we can deliver this large-scale operation as quickly as possible.""Provisional figures released by the Home Office show a total of 7,567 people crossed the Channel in boats between January and April of this year - 27% more than the number of arrivals recorded in the same period last year.

The SNP said closing the family scheme ""without warning"" was ""cruel"". The separate Homes for Ukraine scheme remains open for those who are eligible.This allows people in the UK to host Ukrainian refugees even if they do not have family ties here.More than 200,000 people have come to the UK under these schemes since the start of the conflict, which marks its second anniversary on Saturday.Council funding cut for Ukrainian refugee schemeNew crisis looms for Ukrainians in the UKOn Sunday the government announced Ukrainians who had sought sanctuary in the UK under the schemes could apply for an 18-month visa extension. New arrivals had been granted three years to remain, meaning the first visas were due to expire in March 2025. However, on Monday Mr Pursglove revealed in a written ministerial statement the government was reducing the length of new visas issued under the Homes for Ukraine (HFU) scheme from 36 months to 18 months.The statement also announced the closure of the Ukraine Family Scheme, which came into effect at 15:00 GMT on Monday. Mr Pursglove said the family scheme was created as ""an immediate response to the Russian invasion"". ""Under HFU, there are accommodation checks, a minimum accommodation commitment from the sponsor and safeguarding checks, none of which feature in the Ukraine Family Scheme (UFS),"" he said.""This will strengthen and improve the sustainability of the schemes we provide.""The SNP's Home Affairs spokeswoman Alison Thewliss said: ""The Home Office previously promised to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Ukraine - yet as we prepare to mark the two year anniversary of Putin's illegal war, it is now trying to slip these cruel measures under the radar.""Labour's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said: ""Restricting family rights at a time when Ukrainian troops are under heavy fire in Donetsk sends the wrong message to the people of Ukraine about our willingness to stand with them.""Ministers must urgently explain the justification for these measures and how they will ensure vulnerable Ukrainians are not put at risk by these changes.""Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""The lack of options for Ukrainian and other families separated by war and persecution is already a huge problem. It's concerning that one of the few safe routes created for families to reunite will be closing at such short notice.""This is a reminder of the disadvantages of bespoke, one-off visa schemes that support refugees in the short term but leave people in limbo, anxious and uncertain about their future. Instead of this ad hoc and inconsistent approach, the UK government should ensure the UK resettlement route is utilised as a global scheme and confers the same rights, including refugee family reunion, for all regardless of their nationality.""Mr Pursglove also announced changes to the eligibility requirements for sponsors on the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which he said would ""ensure that visa holders have appropriate accommodation as well as the necessary in-country support to help them assimilate and thrive independently in the UK"". Sponsors for new visas will now need to be British or Irish citizens, or have the right to live permanently in the UK. This is stricter than the requirements were for the family visa, which also allowed a family member in the UK with refugee status to be a sponsor. Previously, a sponsor on the Homes for Ukraine scheme only needed to hold at least six months' permission to stay in the UK from the date of the visa application.Sponsors must also pass security and criminal checks, while councils check the suitability of living arrangements.

"30 November 2023","Glasgow council declares 'housing emergency'","Glasgow council declares 'housing emergency'30 November 2023ShareShareBBCGlasgow has become the second Scottish city to declare a ""housing emergency"" amid mounting pressures on homelessness services.A city council committee agreed the move due to ""unprecedented pressures"" facing the local authority.The council has more than 5,200 open homelessness cases.Meanwhile, the number of homeless refugees has doubled after a streamlined asylum process was introduced by the Home Office in June.The council has already called on the UK government to provide financial as it expects to see more than 1,400 homelessness applications from people granted asylum before the end of 2023.The UK government previously said it offered ""ample support"" to refugees granted leave to remain.Edinburgh City Council became the first Scottish city to declare a housing emergency earlier this month. Argyll and Bute Council did the same in June.Glasgow's administration committee has now followed suit.What does declaring a 'housing emergency' actually mean?Well, it's a good question and one I've been asked a few times in the last month.The councils have their own action plans to alleviate the mounting pressure in the housing system - like getting empty council houses back into circulation and investigating the use of modular housing.But the actions taken by Edinburgh City Council and Glasgow's administration committee are a signal to government that things aren't working and there needs to be intervention.Essentially, they are lobbying for more funding from both the Scottish and UK governments. It's a similar move being taken by local authorities in England.In Scotland, there are record numbers of children in homeless accommodation. Scotland's biggest city has seen a 44% rise in homeless cases since 2019, while a two-bedroom flat in the west of the capital will attract more than 300 bids.In Edinburgh, privately-owned ex-council houses are rented back to the council to house the homeless.A shortage of social housing (sold off under Right to Buy) and the rising rents of the private sector mean lower income households will either be priced out, or find themselves spending years in temporary accommodation waiting for a housing association home.Cynics may say that there are political considerations in these declarations - a Labour council in Edinburgh pointing the finger at SNP-run Holyrood, or an SNP council in Glasgow blaming Tory-run Westminster.But actually, at the ground level, there is consensus among opposing councillors that this is a dire situation.Asylum decisionsCouncillor Allan Casey, Glasgow's homelessness convenor, said the council ""urgently needs resources"" to deal with demand.Mr Casey said: ""As our report outlines, referrals from Mears, the company which currently provides accommodation for those awaiting asylum decisions here in Glasgow, have doubled in recent months.""The city is experiencing an overwhelming increase in people presenting as rough sleepers as well as a significant rise in individuals, from elsewhere in the UK, seeking assistance here in Glasgow.""In a bid to cut the lengthy backlog of asylum claims, the UK government announced plans this year to streamline the application process for claimants from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria and Yemen. Council calls for aid amid refugee housing concernsSome claimants from Sudan are also being considered under the new process.Glasgow is the main dispersal city in Scotland for successful asylum seekers.Rough sleeping is also on the riseSince the decision, a council report showed the number of single people being granted asylum in Glasgow rose from 44 a month in June to 137 in October.The number of families being granted refugee status each month rose from 21 to 39 over the same period.Homelessness services anticipate a budget overspend of £23.6m. This has been revised down from a previous estimate of £27m.

"23 May 2021","Glasgow politicians write to Home Office over immigration policy","Glasgow politicians write to Home Office over immigration policy23 May 2021ShareSharePA MediaHundreds of people gathered in Kenmure Street in Glasgow to prevent the removal of two men by immigration officialsA cross-party group of politicians from Glasgow have written to the Home Office to outline their opposition to the UK's immigration policy. The letter's signatories, which include Nicola Sturgeon, specifically says they oppose unannounced raids.  It comes after hundreds of people gathered in the city earlier this month to prevent the removal of two men by immigration enforcement officials. The Home Office said it would continue to tackle illegal migration.The letter's 27 signatories range from party leaders, including the SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar, and the Greens' Patrick Harvie, to Susan Aitken, the SNP leader of Glasgow City Council, and a range of other SNP, Labour and Green MSPs, MPs and councillors who represent the city.Police release two men from immigration vanMan in immigration van 'thankful' for responseIt is addressed to Home Secretary Priti Patel, and states that they ""deeply oppose"" the UK government's immigration policies. Its New Plan for Immigration includes a pledge to speed up deportations for those who have entered the country by what the UK government calls illegal means. The letter was signed by 27 Glasgow politicians (with signatures continuing onto a third page) and sent to the UK government's home secretaryThe letter continues that it wants to ""explain a little about Scotland's very different attitude to immigration and come together... against the practice of immigration enforcement raids"". It says that ""New Scots"" are welcome in Glasgow and Scotland, and that this ""was very evident last week"" when protesters prevented the removal of two men by immigration officials. The Home Office said at the time that two Indian nationals had been detained and later released on bail over ""suspected immigration offences"", adding that appropriate legal protocol was followed.'Worst possible timing'The letter continues: ""We do not support these raids at any time... They are expensive, harmful, lacking in compassion, and more often than not aimed at people who are no threat to public safety.""It also notes that the raid was carried out at the ""worst possible time"", pointing out that Pollokshields is currently a Covid hotspot. ""To provoke people into coming out and mixing with hundreds of other households is as unforgiveable as it is dangerous,"" it says.  It adds that it was also ""extremely distressing"" for the diverse community to witness the scene on Eid. ""Like dawn raids, your new plan [for immigration] simply has no support or place here in Scotland,"" the letter says.Patel pledges overhaul of asylum seeker rulesCan Priti Patel's asylum plan work? In response to the situation in Glasgow earlier this month, the Home Office issued a statement which said: ""The UK government is tackling illegal immigration and the harm it causes, often to the most vulnerable people by removing those with no right to be in the UK.""The operation in Glasgow was conducted in relation to suspected immigration offences and the two Indian nationals complied with officers at all times.""The UK government continues to tackle illegal migration in all its forms and our New Plan for Immigration will speed up the removal of those who have entered the UK illegally.""Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""The government has a responsibility to remove people from the United Kingdom with no legal status to be here. And that includes some of the individuals, foreign national offenders, and people that have brought great harm to our country.""So we will continue to enforce our laws and legislation to remove those with no legal basis to be in the UK.""What do the new proposals promise?PA MediaMany people-smugglers send asylum seekers across the Channel in dangerously small boatsPowers over immigration are reserved to Westminster, and the UK government recently unveiled new policies for migration. The Home Office said that ""for the first time"" the question of whether asylum seekers enter the UK via another ""safe"" country, such as France would ""have an impact"" on how it dealt with claims.The government would seek the ""rapid removal from the UK"" of rejected applicants, with appeals ""reformed to speed up"" the process, it added.But asylum seekers fleeing persecution or violence and coming to the UK via the ""legal resettlement"" route from countries such as Syria and Iran would straight away get permission to remain in the UK indefinitely, the Home Office said.Under the new plans, anyone who pays criminal gangs to bring them to the UK would only ever receive temporary permission to remain and would be regularly assessed for removal from the UK.  Other proposals include bringing in ""rigorous"" age checks to stop adults entering the country by pretending to be children.The use of hotels to accommodate arrivals will end and the government will bring forward plans to expand the ""asylum estate"".Ms Patel said asylum applicants with criminal records who returned to the UK after being deported would receive a jail sentence of up to five years.

But Mr Yousaf has pledged they will remain at the current levels when councils set their budgets for 2024-25.He described the proposed freeze as evidence of ""the SNP delivering for people when they need it most"". Live coverage of Humza Yousaf's conference speechSturgeon backs SNP's new independence strategyCan SNP's independence plan change union's future?First Minister Humza Yousaf recalls 'panicked' call with in-laws in GazaMr Yousaf did not set out how the government would make up the budgetary shortfall for councils who would have raised taxes.The levy generates about 13% of local government funding, with most of their cash coming from Holyrood funding. Council tax had either been either frozen or capped at 3% since the SNP came to power in 2007, with the Scottish government providing local authorities with extra funding in return.But councils have been allowed to use new powers to set their own rates for the past two years, with most areas seeing rises of between 4% and 7% this year - although residents of Orkney saw their bills increase by 10%.The SNP had a long-standing commitment to scrap and replace council tax and Mr Yousaf said he remained committed to reforming local taxation.Cosla, which represents local authorities, said it had not been warned about the council tax freeze in advance. ""This has longer term implications for all councils right across the country, at a time when we know there are acute financial pressures, and where we are jointly looking at all local revenue raising options,"" a spokesperson said.PA MediaMr Yousaf also said his government would spend an additional £300m on tackling NHS waiting lists in the next three years and raise arts and culture funding by £100m over the next five years.The first minister, whose has family members are trapped in Gaza, called on the UK government to create a refugee resettlement scheme for those caught up in the conflict.He said Scotland would be ""willing to be the first country in the UK to offer safety and sanctuary to those caught up in these terrible attacks"". He condemned the Hamas attack in Israel and the ""collective punishment"" of people in Gaza and called for the UK government to support medical evacuations of injured civilians from Gaza. The tearful Mr Yousaf issued an emotional call for unity as he said there was ""no room"" for hatred of any kind in Scotland. Following the SNP's heavy defeat to Labour in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election, the first minister told party members they could ""either spend time feeling sorry for ourselves"", or ""roll up our sleeves and work harder than ever before for the people of Scotland"". He urged delegates to unite behind the party's independence strategy, based on winning a majority of seats at the next general election, to help build a ""sustained majority"" for Yes.Mr Yousaf said independence was ""neither untested nor unobtainable"" as he insisted a united SNP could ""make it happen"". The most eye-catching announcement in what was a policy rich speech was the decision to freeze council tax next year. That means that whoever you are, wherever you live, your council tax bill will not increase in the 2024/25 financial year.That is a far cry from the possibility of big tax rises for those in more expensive proprieties - an idea that the Scottish government and councils have been consulting on. Humza Yousaf did not spell out how the freeze would be funded at a time when councils are under major financial pressures. That is to be negotiated with local government. The announcement has taken councils by total surprise despite them striking a recent agreement with the Scottish government on joint-working. It should be seen as a political response to the electoral pressure the SNP is under, as demonstrated by their defeat in the Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election. Party sources say they want to recover popularity by focussing more on key issues of public concern like the cost of living and the NHS.There was a time when the SNP sought to abolish council tax. Humza Yousaf now talks about reforming it to make it fairer. But in the short term it will just not be allowed to increase. Other key announcements included plans to issue the first ever Scottish government bonds on the international bond market to raise funds for infrastructure projects, and plans to ""anchor a new offshore wind supply chain"" in Scotland with up to £500m in funding over five years - with the government aiming to ensure vital parts such as turbines are made at home instead of being imported from abroad. The SNP leader said issuing the first ever Scottish government investment bonds by 2026 - subject to ""due diligence and market testing"" - would help enhance Scotland's global standing.""This will bring Scotland to the attention of investors across the world,"" he said.""We will also demonstrate the credibility to international markets that we will need when we become an international country.""The first minister also announced a pilot scheme for £1,000 to be given to domestic abuse survivors fleeing their partners as part of a £500,000 ""fund to leave"" which will be distributed to Women's Aid groups for pilot schemes in Glasgow, South Lanarkshire, North Lanarkshire, Edinburgh and Fife.Nicola Sturgeon has backed the SNP's new independence strategyMr Yousaf said the government will commit £400,000 to the redevelopment of Union Street in Aberdeen city centre, as well as supporting the Eden Project in Dundee, the Clyde Mission in Glasgow and improvement works in the St James Quarter in Edinburgh. He pledged ministers will invest an extra £100m in each of the next three years to cut NHS waiting lists by an estimated 100,000 patients by 2026, when the next Holyrood election is scheduled to take place. The number of patients on hospital waiting lists in Scotland has increased to 667,746, quarterly figures to June showed. That was up from almost 625,000 in February.Home Secretary Suella Braverman came in for criticism during the speech as Mr Yousaf criticised the UK government's immigration policy. He condemned Ms Braverman for warning of a ""hurricane"" of migration coming to the UK and said that with independence Scotland could decide its own immigration policy.Referencing a viral social media post from the Tory conference, he said: ""Suella Braverman's most compassionate moment came when she stood on the tail of a guide dog.""Taking aim at Labour, the first minister told delegates he had ""no idea what Keir Starmer stands for"". Humza Yousaf's speech went down very well with those in the conference hall. There were whoops, standing ovations and applause aplenty.But there's no denying SNP conference is smaller (and perhaps feels a bit flatter) than previous years.Not only has the conference been moved to a smaller hall than last year, but there were still quite a few empty seats for Mr Yousaf's speech.Aberdeen can be a long journey for many delegates, and attending any political party conference isn't cheap. But the SNP will hope that a quieter conference won't mean fewer activists willing to put a shift in for the party at the next election.The SNP's new independence strategy, agreed by delegates on Sunday, has ditched Nicola Sturgeon's plan for a de facto referendum.However, arriving at the conference on Monday, she gave her ""full unequivocal support"" to the new plan.In his keynote speech Mr Yousaf thanked Ms Sturgeon, who he credited with having ""transformed Scotland"". The top line of the party's manifesto will be ""vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country"", the conference was told.""And that's because independence is about building a better Scotland,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""It's about raising living standards. It's about protecting our NHS. Above all, it's about a stronger economy.

The day is officially marked on Saturday and the motion calls for more to be done to encourage women into the engineering and tech sectors.Tuesday morning's committee pick is the economy committee as it continues its inquiry on bank branch closures - this time taking evidence from the banks themselves.Representatives from TSB, Santander, Lloyds, Clydesdale and RBS will appear before the committee.

It condemns the Home Office contractor's action as ""wholly unacceptable"".And it warns Serco's actions will ""trigger a humanitarian crisis in Glasgow"" and create ""imminent risk of significant harm to a vulnerable group"".The letter was signed by councillors Susan Aitken, Mhairi Hunter, Jennifer Layden (SNP); Martha Wardrop (Green); Frank McAveety (Labour); and MPs Alison Thewliss, Patrick Grady, David Linden, Carol Monaghan, Chris Stephens and Stewart McDonald (SNP) and Paul Sweeney (Labour). 'Vulnerable tenants'Refugee groups and public sector organisations have condemned the moves since details broke over the weekend.Many of the failed asylum seekers are housed in properties leased from housing associations by Serco.The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations (SFHA) said it had concerns about the eviction policy.Sally Thomas, chief executive of SFHA, said: ""Serco has been criticised in the past for poor practice in how it treats vulnerable tenants, and appeared to improve its policy and practice on how it interacts with asylum seekers who have had asylum claims refused.""We are concerned now that Serco is in danger of putting profit before people, failing to work within the spirit of the law, and letting down vulnerable households in the support and inadequate time they need to make alternative housing arrangements.""Serco has said it is sympathetic to the plight of the residents but says it has been covering the cost of housing the tenants after their applications have been refused.The first of the notices to change locks have been issuedThe company said it had been working with the city council on the process for the last four months.Serco's Jenni Halliday said: ""Serco has been providing housing free of charge to over 300 former asylum seekers who no longer have the right to stay in the UK. ""We have been paying for the rent, the rates, the heating and lighting, and insurance on their properties, in many cases for many months all at our own expense. ""Each of these former asylum seekers have been refused the right to stay in the UK by the Government and the Home Office does not fund Serco to provide them with accommodation.""The Home Office provides free, fully-furnished accommodation to asylum seekers while applications are being considered. A Home Office spokesman said: ""While an asylum claim is outstanding, we would not be seeking removal. ""Even if an asylum claim has failed, we will provide accommodation for those who would otherwise be destitute and who are temporarily unable to leave the UK because of a practical or legal obstacle.""However, it is right that we prepare for someone's removal if they do not have a lawful basis to stay in the UK and they are not pursuing an appeal.""","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-45007011"

The bill, which aims to deport those arriving in the UK without permission, would deny the majority of refugees any access to the asylum system, the Joint Committee on Human Rights said.Children and victims of trafficking and modern slavery would be impacted, chairwoman Joanna Cherry added.The government said it took its international obligations seriously.However, it has faced criticism from opposition parties and charities, who argue the bill is unworkable and could breach international law.The legislation, intended to try to stop people crossing the English Channel in small boats, has already passed the Commons but has run into strong opposition in the House of Lords.It would give ministers the power to remove anyone arriving in the UK illegally, and migrants would then be barred from claiming asylum.Instead they would be detained and removed, either to Rwanda - with which the UK has an agreement - or another ""safe country"".The bill would enshrine in law broad detention and search powers, and deny protections to modern slavery victims, as well as removing the right of appeals following age assessments. Migration bill passes as Tory rebellion defusedThe hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Most asylum seekers arriving in the UK irregularly and indirectly after the legislation is passed would have their claim ""declared inadmissible"", the committee's report, Legislative Scrutiny: Illegal Migration Bill, says.Ms Cherry, an SNP MP and a barrister, said the most vulnerable would be disproportionately affected.""They will also be subject to detention without time limit and removal from the UK irrespective of the merits of their claims,"" she said.""By treating victims of modern slavery as 'illegal migrants' subject to detention and removal, this bill would breach our legal obligations to such victims and would risk increasing trafficking of vulnerable people.""She added that most people fleeing persecution or conflict currently have ""no safe and legal way of getting here"".The committee chairwoman also highlighted that Home Secretary Suella Braverman had taken the ""unusual step of making a statutory declaration under the Human Rights Act that she was unable to state that the bill was compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)"" when she introduced the bill to Parliament.""However, she has stated elsewhere that the bill is compatible with international law. We disagree.""Having carried out legislative scrutiny of the bill, it is overwhelmingly clear that it breaches a number of the UK's international human rights obligations including the ECHR, and risks breaching others.""The government has said the plans are central to achieving Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's pledge to stop small boat crossings - one of his five key priorities.The Home Office also argued that excluding children and modern slavery victims from the scope of the bill could provide ""incentives"" to human traffickers.A spokesperson said: ""It is not compassionate to allow people to die in the Channel.""We cannot allow a system to continue where people are incentivised to make dangerous, illegal and unnecessary journeys to the UK, which is why the Illegal Migration Bill will see people who enter the country swiftly returned home if it is safe or removed to a safe third country.""They continued, saying the legislation would send ""a clear message that the exploitation of people ferried across the Channel must end"", adding: ""We remain committed to ensuring the bill passes through Parliament as soon as possible so we can stop the boats.""How is the UK stopping Channel crossings?The hurdles in Sunak's race to pass Migration BillLords debate Illegal Migration Bill until 4amMigration bill passes as Tory rebellion defusedHome OfficeRefugees and asylum seekersMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-65869514"

So that we have the best picture we can have of what the potential sources of accommodation could be, and then to be able to offer the best match between the needs of people who will come to Wales and our ability to meet those needs.""Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said councils were ""ready to help new arrivals"".""Councils will be central in helping families settle into their communities and access public services, including schools, public health and other support, including access to trauma counselling,"" he said. Mr Drakeford has also, along with Scotland's first minister, written to the UK government to confirm their commitment in contributing to its community sponsorship scheme as ""super sponsors"".Shadow social justice minister for the Conservatives, Mark Isherwood, said he was ""pleased the Welsh government wants to play its part"", but added ""rhetoric has to be matched by action"".""These refugees, fleeing an unjust war on their homeland, need homes, healthcare, jobs, and education. The Labour government should be allocating resources for this, but we still have no details,"" he said.The UK government announced on Sunday that households would be offered £350 a month to open their homes to refugees.With this offer, the Welsh and Scottish governments are trying to do two main things.They want to make the process speedier - both first ministers have criticised how slowly visas are being granted.Secondly, they want to build a structure around this scheme to try to streamline the many logistical complexities.Volunteers will need background checks to make sure they're safe for vulnerable people to live with.Those same volunteers will also need support with the language barrier and signposting to services that can help traumatised people settle, as well as more day-to-day matters like arranging school places.But in the letter, Mark Drakeford and Nicola Sturgeon repeat their view that the UK government should waive visa requirements and adopt the approach of EU countries who are permitting three-year residencies for refugees.Call to reduce nuclear weaponsThe first minister also called on governments to ""redouble their efforts"" to reduce the number of nuclear weapons.At the start of his country's invasion of Ukraine, President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on ""special"" alert. Despite abstaining on a Plaid Cymru Senedd vote on the issue earlier this week, Mark Drakeford reaffirmed his long-term opposition to nuclear weapons.He said: ""I think anybody sensible looking at the world we are in, knowing that President Putin has nuclear weapons in his hands, would want to see a world in which the reduction in nuclear weapons across the world ought to be an effort that any sensible government would wish to pursue.""But it should be done ""in concert with other nations"" rather than unilaterally by the UK government, he said.""Ground was lost in the last decade on efforts that had gone on across the world to reduce the volume of nuclear weapons...

Mr Gray, who led Humza Yousaf's SNP leadership campaign last year, had been the wellbeing economy, fair work and energy secretary since last March.Mr Matheson quit ahead of the release of a report into an £11k data roaming bill racked up on his parliamentary iPad.Elena Whitham also resigned as drugs minister this week for health reasons. Scottish health secretary quits over £11k iPad billYousaf to appoint successor after Matheson resignationWho is iPad row minister Michael Matheson?Mr Yousaf, the first minister, has reshuffled his government ministers after Mr Matheson quit on Thursday morning. The changes include: Mairi McAllan has taken over the economy role, combined with her current net zero brief, becoming the wellbeing economy, net zero and energy secretary.Her responsibilities for transport are to be passed to her minister Fiona Hyslop, who is being promoted from transport minister to transport secretary.Kaukab Stewart - the first woman of colour to enter the Scottish government - will be minister for culture, Europe and international development.She will replace Christina McKelvie, who was given Ms Whitham's former drugs and alcohol brief.And Perthshire South and Kinross-shire MSP Jim Fairlie - who supported Kate Forbes in the leadership race when she stood against Mr Yousaf - is to join the government as the minister for agriculture and connectivity. Parliament will be asked to approve the appointments of new ministers Ms Hyslop, Mr Fairlie and Ms Stewart. PA MediaMr Yousaf unveiled his new cabinet team on Thursday afternoonMr Matheson announced he was standing down because he said he did not want a row over the bill - incurred during a family holiday to Morocco - to become a distraction from the government's work.The £11,000 bill was initially paid out of the public purse. When details of the fees emerged in November, Mr Matheson said the device had been used exclusively for parliamentary work. He later admitted his sons had used the iPad's data as a hotspot to watch football matches. He apologised and repaid the fees. The Scottish Parliament Corporate Body (SPCB) has been investigating whether Mr Matheson made an improper expenses claim. Getty ImagesHealth Secretary Michael Matheson said he did not want to become a distraction for the governmentThe SNP MSP was told on Thursday that he would shortly be issued with a draft report of the investigation's provisional findings. He has been given two weeks to respond. Mr Matheson had served as a government minister for more than 12 years, including almost a year as health secretary.Mr Gray was an MP from 2015 to 2021, when he quit Westminster to seek election to the Scottish Parliament.After winning the Airdrie and Shotts seat, he was appointed minister for culture, Europe and international development in January 2022. He was later given ministerial responsibility for Ukrainian refugees. Ms Hyslop, who stepped down from the government after 14 years in 2021, returned to government as transport minister in June under then transport secretary Ms McAllan.Ms McAllan joined the government in March, becoming Scotland's first net zero and just transition secretary at the age of 30. The transport brief was added to her role in June.Meghan Gallacher, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme she found it ""extraordinary"" that Mr Yousaf had stood by Matheson over the iPad bill. She said Mr Matheson had been been distracted from his job for months, adding: ""He should have been sacked and that's down to Humza Yousaf being weak.""Ms Gallacher also said Neil Gray had a ""tough job ahead of him"" to drive down A&E waiting times and NHS waiting lists.Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: ""This weak first minister can reshuffle the pack all he wants - the fact is that all the cards left are jokers.""After 17 years it is clear that this tired SNP government is out of ideas and out of road.""Who is Neil Gray?By Andrew Kerr, Scottish political correspondentNeil Gray is a relative newcomer to Holyrood and now finds himself in charge of a multi-billion pound health budget.He became a member of the Scottish Parliament in 2021 - after quitting his Westminster Airdrie and Shotts seat.After a stint at the BBC he worked for the former health secretary, Alex Neil, in his constituency.He is close to Humza Yousaf and his nickname for the first minister is ""Boss"".When Nicola Sturgeon resigned he received a positive response from members but backed Humza Yousaf for the top job.Perhaps that though could indicate a well-spring of support if there was ever a vacancy for first minister?

"17 February 2023","Nicola Sturgeon: Why has no one said they will stand to replace her?","Nicola Sturgeon: Why has no one said they will stand to replace her?17 February 2023ShareGlenn CampbellPolitical editor, BBC ScotlandShareGetty ImagesNicola Sturgeon announced she was stepping down as SNP leader and first minister on WednesdayWhen Alex Salmond quit after the independence referendum, there was little doubt about who would succeed him. Nicola Sturgeon was the obvious candidate and in the end secured the job without anyone challenging her for it. It was a coronation rather than a contest. There hasn't been a contest for the SNP's top job for nearly two decades. The expectation is there will be one this time but so far there are no official candidates. There are probably several reasons for that. Firstly, a sense of dignity. Allowing a little space for reflection on Nicola Sturgeon's decision and her contribution to Scottish politics. Not being seen as overly eager. Allowing party bosses to decide the rules. Secondly, practicality. Her resignation has taken potential candidates by surprise. They did not get much warning that Nicola Sturgeon was about to quit and building a campaign team and assessing potential support within the party takes time. Thirdly, Nicola Sturgeon's political domination. As she herself acknowledged, it is not easy for others to establish themselves when so much political debate is focussed on a single figure. Why did Nicola Sturgeon resign as first minister?What is Nicola Sturgeon's report card?Who will replace Nicola Sturgeon?While the current first minister has promoted some younger MSPs into her government and once-upon-a-time named Kate Forbes and Humza Yousaf as potential leaders, succession planning has not been the most obvious feature of her tenure. There is still an array of possible contenders and for some the key decision - to stand or not - may depend on what someone else decides to do. Don't expect any cabinet minister to formally declare until they hear from the deputy first minister, John Swinney. Vastly experienced in government and hugely popular in the party - only the boldest would stand against him. If he decides not to go for it - and don't forget he previously served an unhappy spell as SNP leader in the early 2000s when the party was in opposition and far less popular - there could be a wider contest. Getty ImagesJohn Swinney is hugely experienced and popular in the partyThe finance secretary Kate Forbes, the constitution secretary Angus Robertson, the health secretary Humza Yousaf and the justice secretary Keith Brown are all considered potential candidates. None have ruled themselves out. The decision Keith Brown makes is also of particular significance. If he was to stand for leader, he may wish to demonstrate confidence in his candidacy by standing down as SNP deputy leader. There is no obligation for him to give up the deputy role but if he chose to do so that would trigger a second election contest and the potential for some interesting informal pairings of candidates: male/female, urban/rural, left/right, youth/experience. To be clear, the two contests would be separate but that did not stop Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon backing one another for leader and deputy in what they styled as a ""joint-ticket"" in their successful 2004 campaign. While refugee minister, Neil Gray is understood to be considering running for the top job, some have tipped him as a potential running mate for a more experienced leadership candidate. Others have suggested the environment minister Mairi MacAllan and transport minister Jenny Gilruth for a similar role. From innumerable phone calls with SNP politicians and insiders today, my very strong sense is that there is little appetite for an MP becoming party leader. That's what Alex Salmond did in 2004 when the party was in opposition. However, in government, there is an expectation that the new leader would automatically become first minister and only an MSP can take on that role. PA MediaNicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond backed each other for leader and deputy in 2004That is a widely perceived as an obstacle to a high profile MP like Joanna Cherry running but she has already ruled herself out. However, her ally in opposition to the gender recognition reform bill Ash Regan - an MSP who resigned as a minister over the issue - is said to be ""strongly considering"" running. Any potential candidate will need the support of 100 party members from 20 different SNP branches to qualify. The party's ruling body - the national executive committee - has decided that nominations will close on Friday 24 February, with voting taking place during a two week period starting on Monday 13 March. That means the SNP's new leader will be announced on Monday 27 March, making it possible for the winner to take over as first minister later the same week before the Scottish Parliament's Easter break.

We have no intention of splitting these groups up. ""The mothers have to stay with them, they are the legal guardians.""They are coming here and we are going to look after them, but it is only until such a time as they can go back to Ukraine.""But he said the situation in Ukraine was horrendous and very worrying for the orphanage mothers and the older children who understand what is happening in their home country.Mr Carr also paid tribute to Mr Blackford, who has been working with the charity to secure the children's passage to the UK.Up to 3,000 people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine will be offered immediate temporary accommodation in Scotland.The Scottish government has also announced a further £15m of funding will be made available to help refugees, including £11m for local councils and £2.5m for temporary accommodation.War in Ukraine: More coverage LIVE: Latest updates from Ukraine and nearbyKYIV: Ukraine generals on why Kyiv will not fall easilyPROTEST: Cracks in Kremlin's war message exposed MARIUPOL: Infection and hunger as hundreds hide in cellarIN DEPTH: Full coverage of the conflictRussia-Ukraine warEdinburghUkraine","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-60813006"

"14 June 2022","Rwanda asylum plan: Court allows first flight to go ahead","Rwanda asylum plan: Court allows first flight to go ahead14 June 2022ShareDulcie LeeBBC NewsShareGetty ImagesThe government's first flight taking asylum seekers to Rwanda can go ahead on Tuesday, appeal court judges say.It supports a previous decision by the High Court that it was in the ""public interest"" for the government to carry out its policies.Under the scheme, some of those entering the UK illegally will be flown to Rwanda to apply for asylum there.Campaigners were trying to stop the flight before a full hearing on whether the policy is lawful next month.The charity Detention Action and the PCS union that represents some Border Force staff, who were among the groups who brought the case, said they were ""disappointed"" by the decision.Eight people are expected to fly to the landlocked east African country on Tuesday evening, a Home Office source told the BBC.The numbers drastically reduced after legal challenges relating to modern slavery and human rights claims, according to a government source.Why are asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda?Is Rwanda a land of safety or fear?The Rwanda hotels waiting to cash in on UK asylum dealThe government says the scheme will discourage dangerous journeys across the English Channel and therefore undermine smuggling gangs, but charities, religious leaders and opposition parties have criticised it.People sent to Rwanda will be given accommodation and support while their asylum application is considered by the Rwandan government.If they are successful, they can stay there with up to five years' access to education and support.If they are not, they will be offered the chance to apply for other immigration routes, but could still face deportation.At the urgent hearing on Monday, three senior judges ruled there was no error in the High Court judge's decision last week to allow the flight to go ahead.They also refused permission for an appeal to the Supreme Court against their decision.At-a-glance: What's happened so farThe PM announces a five-year £120m trial in which some asylum seekers will get a one-way ticket to RwandaIt faces widespread opposition from more than 160 charities and campaign groups, a small number of which launch a legal challengeHome Office lawyers say the plan is in the public interest - and the High Court says there is no lawful reason to stop the flightCampaigners appeal the ruling but are unsuccessfulJudges will consider whether the whole Rwanda policy is lawful next month - this could see some people returned to the UK from Rwanda if it is ruled illegalJust before the ruling, SNP home affairs spokesman Stuart McDonald told MPs in the Commons it was a ""cash-for-deportations"" policy ""akin to state-sponsored trafficking and transportation"".But Home Office minister Tom Pursglove replied that the comparison was ""plain wrong"" and ""very offensive not just to this government but also, I'd argue, hugely offensive to the Rwandans too"".Mr Pursglove said the policy offers ""new opportunities for those relocated to Rwanda"" and ""people will no longer be able to pay evil people smugglers to go to a destination of their choice while passing through safe, sometimes several safe, countries.""Meanwhile, the head of the UN Refugee Agency, Filippo Grandi, said the plans were ""all wrong"" and could set a ""catastrophic"" precedent.And leaders of the Church of England - including the archbishops of Canterbury and York - wrote in the Times that it was an ""immoral policy that shames Britain"".Later on Monday a High Court judge dismissed a separate, similar challenge brought by charity Asylum Aid.A lawyer for the charity argued asylum seekers were ""effectively guinea pigs"" for a process that hadn't been properly tested, but the judge concluded some of their arguments were ""thin"".More than 10,000 people have made the dangerous journey across the Channel so far this year. Another 37 people were brought into Dover by Border Force earlier on Monday.This is a major legal victory for Home Secretary Priti Patel.The Court of Appeal's decision underlines one of the principles of how the law works: if a judge decides there's no pressing need for an injunction, then unless there is a major legal fault with their reasoning, more senior judges should not overturn their decision.General concerns about the human rights of would-be passengers, in the broadest sense of the phrase, have been repeatedly raised over the last couple of days.Yet the courts have shown, contrary to the views of some commentators, that those safeguards are not a bar to the government pursuing its policy objectives if the law appears to be correct.Lord Justice Singh noted that the outcome of next month's full challenge to the policy could hypothetically see asylum seekers returned to the UK, were they to win the day.But the more immediate question is this: how many asylum seekers will actually be on the flight?LIQUID DIET: Are meal replacement drinks good for you?'YOU NEED KINDNESS, BUT TOUGHNESS TOO': A day in the life of a school attendance officerRefugees and asylum seekersRwanda","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-61789982"

He said ""more radical options"" were needed to deal with the ""crisis"".Ms Braverman is under pressure to deal with overcrowding at the Manston asylum processing centre in Kent, which has reportedly led to outbreaks of disease and violence.Braverman was warned about migrant overcrowdingMigrant centre attacker had no far-right links - MPWhy are there problems at Manston migrant centre?How many migrants cross the Channel in small boats?In a Commons statement, she rejected claims she had deliberately blocked the use of hotels to ease the pressure on Manston and promised to fix the ""hopelessly lax"" asylum system.Some 4,000 people are being held at the former RAF base which is only designed to accommodate 1,600 people on a temporary basis.Hundreds of people were moved there on Sunday after a man threw firebombs at a separate immigration centre in Dover. He was later found dead nearby.A report from a visit by the chief inspector of prisons in July found the centre had considerably improved but still identified issues such as no access to fresh air or exercise and a lack of beds, with people sleeping on rubber mats on the floor. Since then, chief inspector Charlie Taylor said the situation had ""significantly deteriorated"". Ms Braverman warned in her statement about using ""inflammatory language"" about illegal immigration but she has been attacked by refugee charities for using the word  ""invasion"" to describe the number of people crossing the English Channel in small boats.The Refugee Council said: ""To describe the serious and complex situation created by the asylum crisis as an 'invasion' is appalling, wrong and dangerous.""These are men, women and children fleeing war, persecution and conflict.""2:26Braverman: ""There are some people who would prefer to be rid of me... let them try""Asked on Today if Ms Braverman had been wrong to use the word, Mr Jenrick said: ""I think in this job you do have to use your language carefully but you also have to accept that many millions of people across this country are rightfully extremely concerned about this issue and we mustn't diminish that.""It's not a phrase that I've used but I do understand the need to be straightforward with the general public about the challenge that we as ministers face.""In an interview with Sky News earlier, Mr Jenrick said he ""would never demonise people coming to this country in pursuit of a better life"" but the word ""invasion"" was ""a way of describing the sheer scale of the challenge"". Appearing on BBC Breakfast, he was repeatedly pressed on whether he would use the word himself. In response, he said ""I've just used the word"" and said it expressed ""the very real concerns that some members of the public feel who live in places like Dover"". Mr Jenrick said conditions at Manston were ""not as we would want them to be"" and ministers needed to ""ensure it returns to a well-run, compassionate, humane site"".He blamed the ""sheer number of migrants who have crossed the Channel in recent weeks"" for putting ""immense pressure"" on the system. However, he said reports of outbreaks of diphtheria, MRSA and scabies at Manston were ""exaggerated"" and the four cases of diphtheria were individuals who had arrived at the site with the condition.  People are only supposed to be kept at Manston for 24 hours for security and identity checks, before being moved into the Home Office's asylum accommodation system, which often means a hotel.When the chief inspector of immigration visited last week, he found some people had been there for over a month. That included one family who had been there for 32 days, sleeping on mats in a marquee.Sources have told the BBC the home secretary was warned by officials the government was acting outside the law by failing to provide alternative accommodation.Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""No home secretary who was serious about public safety or national security would use highly inflammatory language on the day after a dangerous petrol bomb attack on a Dover initial processing centre."" The SNP said Ms Braverman's ""incendiary language makes a mockery of [prime minister] Rishi Sunak's claims about so-called compassionate conservatism"". But Nigel Farage, former leader of the Brexit Party and UKIP, said in a Twitter video Ms Braverman was right to use the word ""invasion"".""I really hope she stays in post but believe me the establishment are out to get her because she's got the guts to say many of these people are just not refugees,"" he added.A record number of migrants have arrived in the UK on small boats this year, with nearly 1,000 making the crossing on Saturday, a further 468 crossing on Sunday and 46 on Monday. The home secretary told MPs on Monday that taxpayers face ""a bill of £6.8m a day for hotel accommodation"" for migrants.How many migrants cross Channel in small boats?What is Manston migrant centre?Braverman warned about migrant overcrowdingHome OfficeSuella BravermanManstonRefugees and asylum seekersDoverMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-63466532"

"23 November 2021","Councils to be forced to take child asylum seekers","Councils to be forced to take child asylum seekers23 November 2021ShareMark Easton and Callum MayBBC NewsSharePA MediaCouncils across the UK are to be forced to care for some of the unaccompanied asylum seeker children who have arrived via the English Channel in small boats.Immigration minister Kevin Foster said the decision was not taken lightly but was in the children's best interests.Authorities will take children now being looked after by Kent and other councils on England's south coast.More than 100 children are living in hotels because of a shortage of places in children's homes. The change will see all 217 UK authorities with social services departments obliged to accept an allocation of the children. The Home Office said it was taking ""urgent steps"" to allocate places in care for asylum-seeking children.It has sent councils across the UK a letter giving them two weeks to present reasons why they should not accept them.The letter says they will not need to accept more asylum-seeking children if they are already caring for a number that makes up 0.07% of their general child population.The government will pay councils £143 per child per night under the scheme.Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said councils around the UK needed to ""play their part"" in offering accommodation to asylum seekers.The UK migrant dilemma - it's all about BrexitWhat happens to migrants who reach the UK?Migrant crossings to UK by boat triple 2020 totalThe vast majority of councils have already offered places to unaccompanied children, according to Nick Forbes, chairman of the Local Government Association's asylum, refugee and migration taskforce.But the Labour politician told the BBC he was ""very disappointed"" that about 15 to 30 councils - out of 217 - were yet to take any children.Mr Forbes, who is also the leader of Newcastle City Council, said some local authorities were reluctant to volunteer due to the ""chaotic asylum system"" and national shortage of social workers and foster care placements.It comes as the number of migrants to have reached the UK by boat this year has risen to more than three times the 2020 total. The Home Office said 886 people arrived on Saturday, bringing the 2021 total to more than 25,700. The figure for last year was 8,469.However, increased security and Covid restrictions have made traditional routes less viable for migrants and the overall number of people to have claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months ending June 2021 was 31,115, a 4% year-on-year fall.The people who cross the Channel come to the UK from the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the world - including Yemen, Eritrea, Chad, Egypt, Sudan and Iraq.Under international law, people have the right to seek asylum in whichever country they arrive, and there is nothing to say they must seek asylum in the first safe country. It is very hard to apply to the UK for asylum unless you are already in the country.Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government decision to compel councils to take unaccompanied children was ""important"". He said it ""should reduce the unacceptable delays in vulnerable children, who have often experienced great trauma, getting the vital care they need"".However, local government sources say there are concerns about the funding councils - which are already under financial pressure - will receive.The Conservative leader of the Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, Councillor James Jamieson, said: ""These new arrangements must continue to swiftly take into account existing pressures in local areas.""The home secretary criticised Scottish councils in the Commons on Monday for the numbers of children they had taken.Kelly Parry, an SNP councillor who speaks for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, said they were committed to participating on a voluntary basis and were already providing a ""proportionate share"" of placements.What happens to migrants in the English Channel?If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British portIf they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take themEach country has search-and-rescue zonesAn EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it.Additional reporting by Alex Kleiderman and Dulcie LeeSTING - 'IS THAT MY DESTINY?': The 100 million selling artist on family and fameIN PRISON WITH NELSON MANDELA: Fellow inmate Ahmed Kathrada speaks about being imprisoned under the Apartheid regimeHow is the UK stopping Channel crossings?Minister to lead review into migrant crossingsThe UK migrant dilemma - it's all about BrexitMigrant crossings to UK by boat triple 2020 totalMigrant boats could be turned back in new UK moveKent County CouncilUK immigrationChildrenHome OfficeEnglish ChannelImmigrationPriti PatelLocal governmentMigration","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-59382187"

"1 October 2020","Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries","Asylum seekers could be processed on old ferries1 October 2020ShareSharePA MediaMinisters are considering converting disused ferries moored off the coast to process people seeking asylum in the UK.According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in the UK in 2019 - down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002.Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK."" Labour called the proposal to process people on ferries ""unconscionable"".The most senior civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system.Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic islandFleeing the Syrian war for BelfastWhat happens to migrants who reach the UK?Asylum seekers criticise military camp housingHome Secretary Priti Patel asked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore.On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office had carried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed.Now the Times reports that the government is giving ""serious consideration"" to the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The paper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"".Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas.He said: ""We've been looking at what a whole host of other countries do in order to bring innovation into our own system. ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers... this is in the realm of the brainstorming stage of a future policy.""Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational sense… so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"".How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast?Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term.The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office.Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them.But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boats are at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new.Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw, found himself in a row with his own party about what the Labour government should do about the issue.So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours.Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said Labour would oppose any move to use ferries, adding: ""Even considering this is appalling."" He accused the government of ""lurching from one inhumane and impractical idea to another"" and claimed it had ""lost control and all sense of compassion"". The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"".But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers.He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated.""He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which has controversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekers since the 1980s.The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossing the Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September.Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UKA Home Office source said this week that ministers were looking at ""every option that can stop small boat crossings and fix the asylum system"", but no final decisions had been made.Nearly 7,000 people have reached the UK in more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019.But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. Tory MP Natalie Elphicke, who represents Dover, said the government had been ""clear they are going to take whatever action is necessary to put a stop to these small boat crossings"".She told the BBC No 10 and the Home Office were looking at a ""whole range of things"" to address the ""draw factor"" of the UK, ""from cruise ships and ferries through to offshore fast track assessment centres, through to changing the immigration law"".Earlier in the Commons, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Parliament the government was ""actively looking at the steps that we can take"" to stop illegal crossings in the English Channel so the UK can ""maintain our commitment to providing a safe haven"" but also ""safeguard our borders"".Eligible for asylumTo be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation.A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination.This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year.While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54366346"
"6 February 2024","Rishi Sunak says he was taken by surprise on £1,000 Rwanda bet","Rishi Sunak says he was taken by surprise on £1,000 Rwanda bet6 February 2024ShareSam FrancisPolitical reporter, BBC NewsSharePA MediaThe prime minister said he took the bet with Piers Morgan to ""underline"" his commitment to the Rwanda policyThe prime minister said he was ""taken by surprise"" when he agreed to make a £1,000 bet over his Rwanda policy.Rishi Sunak said he was ""not a betting person"", but denied it was a mistake after shaking hands with TalkTV's Piers Morgan that deportation flights would take off before the next election. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Sunak said he was trying to convey his ""absolute commitment"" to the policy. Labour said it showed he was ""totally out of touch with working people"".Opposition parties attack PM over £1,000 Rwanda betWhat is the UK's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda?Mr Sunak dismissed suggestions that he did not understand financial pressures facing ordinary households.The bet, which will go to charity, exceeds the £900 cost-of-living payments paid to eligible households on means-tested benefits. The prime minister said he set the target to halve inflation by the end of last year because of cost of living pressures, and inflation had come down from 11% to 4% which ""eases the burden"" on families, he said.Pushed on whether he understood the pressure on low income families, Mr Sunak says he was ""sad"" to hear about parents being so low on money they have been  watering down baby formula for their infants.He argued his government's cuts to national insurance had helped working families, alongside providing £100bn in support for ""the most vulnerable in society"".""Taken in the round, there's lots of support for the people who need it"", he said.The pledge on inflation was one of the PM's five promises, alongside the policy of sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda. It aims to deter people from crossing the Channel, and is key part of Mr Sunak's pledge to ""stop the boats"". However, the plan has been stalled by legal challenges, with no deportation flights taking off yet. The bet was ""underlining my absolute commitment to this policy and my desire to get it through parliament and up and running"", Mr Sunak said.In an attempt to revive the policy, the government introduced legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country but the bill needs to be approved by the House of Lords, where it has faced significant opposition, before it becomes law. The government has said it is still aiming for flights to take off by the spring.ReutersLegal challenges meant the first Rwanda flight was cancelled shortly before take-off in June 2022In an interview on TalkTV, Mr Morgan challenged the PM: ""I'll bet you £1,000 to a refugee charity you don't get anybody on those planes before the election.""Shaking hands with the presenter, Mr Sunak said: ""I want to get people on the planes.""Mr Sunak has said he expects a general election to be held in the second half of this year and one must legally take place by the end of January 2025.Following Mr Sunak's comments that he was not ""not a betting person"" several people highlighted the prime minister had previously discussed betting on cricket while working as an investment banker.Last year Mr Sunak told BBC Radio's Test Match Special programme he enjoyed ""quite dangerous"" spread-betting when he was young investment banker in the US. He said that he had gambled on various parts of the game including ""next wicket partnership, next wicket for, innings total"".Asked if Mr Sunak was a reformed former gambler, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: ""He is not a betting man in general.""Opposition parties have criticised Mr Sunak for taking the bet. Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: ""Most people when they are hit with a surprise £1,000 bill worry about how they are going to make their next mortgage payments or put food on the table for their children. ""Instead, the prime minister does not even register the significance of that amount of money. Out of touch does not even begin to describe Sunak.""The SNP said it had reported Mr Sunak for a potential breach of ministerial rules over the ""grotesque"" bet.The party's Cabinet Office spokeswoman, Kirsty Blackman, has written to the PM's independent adviser on ministers' interests, Sir Laurie Magnus, and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, calling for an investigation into whether Mr Sunak broke the Ministerial Code.In her letter, she pointed to rules that state ministers should ensure no conflict appears to arise between their public duties and private interests, and that they should not accept any gift which could appear to compromise their judgement or place them under an improper obligation.

Unaccompanied children who are asylum seekers and the children of asylum seekers will also be able to apply for free tuition in higher or further education. Ola was aged 20 and had been living in Scotland for nine years when the Court of Session case ruled in her favour in 2022. Her whole secondary education had been in Glasgow and she had excelled in her examinations. But when she applied to study medicine in 2020 she was told she could not access free tuition because she was 58 days short of the length of time required to have lived in the country. Ola's parents previously had to borrow money to pay for her tuition at Dundee UniversityThe court ruled the regulations were unlawful in light of articles in the European Convention on Human Rights relating to discrimination and the right to education.Higher and Further Education Minister Graeme Dey said: ""Scotland has a strong track record in supporting our young people. ""I recognise the impact that any delay to an asylum claim can have on a young person's education journey and I hope the changes set out here will go some way to address that.""In addition, the changes we are proposing to capture a range of immigration statues will mean that all students, other than excepted groups, must now meet the same length of residence in the UK - three years - to access support.""Ola's parents previously had to borrow money to pay for her fees while she studied medicine at Dundee University.Following the legal ruling, the Scottish government agreed to cover her tuition for the previous year and going forward.Last week, First Minister Humza Yousaf insisted he was ""absolutely committed"" to free university tuition for all Scottish students despite calls for a rethink.University of Edinburgh principal and vice-chancellor Sir Peter Mathieson had said allowing wealthier families to pay was ""worthy of calm consideration"".He argued the move could prevent a brain drain from Scotland.The first minister said he was ""very proud"" of the SNP's opposition to tuition fees.Tuition fees residency rules breached human rightsScottish governmentImmigrationGlasgowTuition fees","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-65601318"

John Swinney said the financial situation facing the Scottish government was by far the most challenging since devolution.And soaring inflation meant this year's budget was now worth £1.7bn less than when it was introduced last December.Mr Swinney also said savings needed to be made to offset the impact of Brexit, public sector pay deals and help for Ukrainian refugees.The measures he announced included reprioritising £400m from the NHS budget in order to provide a ""fair pay deal"" for health staff - although he stressed that the overall NHS budget was unchanged. Watch the emergency budget review statementThe latest headlines from ScotlandRead more stories on Scottish politicsSome £116m of this had been due to be spent on Covid vaccines, testing and PPE, with a further £38m coming from the mental health budget and £63m from ""re-phasing and pausing"" programmes including the Scottish Trauma Network.It also includes £65m from primary care services and £70m from ""social care and National Care Service re-profiling"". Money will also be taken from budgets across most other Scottish government departments, with Mr Swinney announcing £33m of resource budget savings and £180m of capital savings and financial transaction reductions in his emergency spending review. The capital savings include delays to new college projects and housebuilding.And the measures mean there will be £16m less for the broadband rollout to remoter parts of Scotland, while support for bus operators to upgrade their fleets to low emission vehicles will be reduced by £29m.'Balance the books'Mr Swinney said the Scottish government did not have the necessary borrowing powers to meet the increased costs that were facing it, or to change income tax rates before the start of the next financial year. This meant that every additional pound that was spent in one area meant a pound less could be spent somewhere else, he said.He added: ""I must balance the books, but I am committed to doing so in a way that prioritises funding to help families, to back business, to provide fair pay awards and to protect the delivery of public services.""The review was established in the summer to ""assess any and all opportunities to redirect additional resources to those most in need, reduce the burdens on business and stimulate the Scottish economy"".The figures being thrown around at Holyrood are not insignificant ones, when you consider the Scottish government's total budget is in the region of £50bn.A lot of money has gone towards public sector pay deals, which does at least help workers deal with rising prices themselves.But a worrying amount of cash is simply being lost to inflation, which is wreaking havoc with government budgets as much as household ones.And to make it worse, this is just the beginning.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned he will have difficult choices to make in his autumn statement in a fortnight's time.Mr Swinney then sets his budget for the coming year on 15 December, with many departments braced for real-terms cuts. Holyrood's committees are already hearing grim talk of some services being ""hollowed out"" or shutting down entirely.The coming weeks will be where that talk could become a reality, as ministers are forced to follow through on those difficult choices.Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith the global financial situation ""do not absolve Mr Swinney or his colleagues of responsibility for the position Scotland finds itself in after fifteen years of their government"".She said Mr Swinney had announced ""more huge cuts to health, education and justice"" but had not touched the budget for another independence referendum, and questioned whether now was the time to be introducing a new National Care Service. Labour's Daniel Johnson said ""chaos"" from the UK government had made the situation more difficult.But he also criticised the number of foreign trips taken by the Angus Robertson, the Scottish government's external affairs secretary.Mr Johnson said: ""I note that the cabinet secretary for external affairs has travelled to eight countries in as many months, clocking up almost 22,000 air miles.""What cost control measures are being applied to the expenditures of members of the Government and civil servants?""Mr Swinney's review statement was initially expected within a fortnight of the UK government's infamous mini-budget, which was announced on 23 September by then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng. Amid the resulting fallout at Westminster, which saw most of the plans reversed and both Mr Kwarteng and Prime Minister Liz Truss lose their jobs, the Holyrood update was delayed in anticipation of a UK government autumn statement scheduled for 31 October. That was then pushed back to 17 November but the Scottish government decided it could not wait until then to announce its changes. The Scottish government will announce its budget for next year on 15 December, which will include any changes it intends to make to income tax rates and bands.

Leader Douglas Ross cuts a concerned figure on the front page as the paper says he blamed Boris Johnson and Partygate for significant losses.""Punished"" is how The Times describes what happened to the Scottish Conservatives at the polls. The paper claims Douglas Ross is ""under fire"" from his party for backing Boris Johnson in a U-turn of his previous call for the PM to quit. The paper reports that Mr Ross now blames the prime minister for the collapse of his party in Scotland. He says he ""can't ignore the message"" sent by voters.""Ross under pressure"" is The Scotsman's take on the Scottish Conservatives situation. It claims members are demanding a review into the party's handling of its ""catastrophic"" local election campaign. The report says the ongoing Partygate scandal and the ""spectre"" of Boris Johnson as prime minister was blamed for overshadowing the campaign which struggled to get issues across to voters. But, it says, some also blame Douglas Ross.The weekend i newspaper focuses on the SNP's result, described on the front page as ""stupendous"" by leader Nicola Sturgeon. It credits Scottish Labour with pushing the Tories back and embarking on an ""electoral comeback"".It's Douglas Ross and Boris Johnson on the front of the Scottish Daily Express, which quotes Mr Ross as saying the PM must reflect on the ""really terrible"" council election results. The paper also reports that Mr Ross blames Downing Street lockdown parties for ""vote meltdown"".""Seismic"" is the one-word headline The National uses to describe the SNP results on Friday. A full-page picture of Nicola Sturgeon with newly-elected councillor and former refugee and Glasgow Girl Roza Salih illustrates the mood.Northern Ireland is The Daily Telegraph's focus, reporting Unionist fears that an election victory for the Nationalist Sinn Fein party could result in Northern Ireland splitting from the UK. The paper says such a result could ""complicate"" negotiations on post-Brexit trade checks and ""reignite debate"" about a future referendum on Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland becoming one country.The regional front pages focus on more local results.

He accused the government of ""lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next"".According to Refugee Action, 35,566 asylum applications were made in 2019 down from a peak of 84,000 in 2002.Top Home Office civil servant Matthew Rycroft said ""everything is on the table"" when it comes to ""improving"" the UK's asylum system.And Downing Street said it was looking at what other countries do ""to inform a plan for the UK"". But the Labour leader fiercely criticised the plan, telling reporters: ""This isn't creative thinking... these suggestions are inhuman and the government shouldn't be pursuing them.Patel considered asylum centre on Atlantic islandFleeing the Syrian war for BelfastWhat happens to migrants who reach the UK?Asylum seekers criticise military camp housing""Everybody knows that the biggest problem with asylum seekers' claims is that it takes a long time for the Home Office to process them, that's the problem, it's been there for years.""Get your house in order, get that sorted out instead of lurching from one ridiculous proposition to another.""He called for better international cooperation, adding: ""There is of course an issue with people trying to get to the United Kingdom, but people are fleeing often from persecution.""'Brainstorming ideas'Home Secretary Priti Patel asked officials to look at policies, including housing people who are seeking asylum offshore.On Tuesday, the Financial Times reported the Foreign Office had carried out an assessment for Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean  - which included the practicalities of transferring migrants thousands of miles - and decided not to proceed.Now the Times has reported that the government is giving ""serious consideration"" to the idea of buying retired ferries and converting them into processing centres, but it says the Home Office rejected a proposal to use decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea. The newspaper also says processing migrants on an island off the coast of Scotland had been considered, but First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that ""any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me"".Appearing before the Public Affairs Committee, Home Office Permanent Secretary Mr Rycroft said he would not comment on leaks to newspapers, but that the department was ""brainstorming"" ideas.He said: ""No decisions have been taken.  No final proposals have been put to ministers.""Mr Rycroft said the UK would ""always comply with all of our international obligations"" and civil servants would ""assess all of the various different possible ideas out there to see which are legal and which make operational sense… so that ministers can ultimately make decisions"".How does the government tempt fewer people to attempt a perilous crossing of the Channel to reach the south coast?Well, one idea is to make it clear that even a successful crossing won't mean getting to stay in the UK - at least in the short term.The government is exploring ""all sorts of options"" - not my words, but those of the most senior civil servant in the Home Office.Hence the recent headlines about transferring asylum seekers to a lump of British rock in the middle of the South Atlantic - Ascension Island, or buying an old ferry to house them.But remember, although the numbers coming over the Channel in boats are at a record high, they are still a small proportion of overall asylum seekers coming to the UK. And rows about asylum are far from new.Twenty years ago, it was the then-Home Secretary, Jack Straw, found himself in a row with his own party about what the Labour government should do about the issue.So this is an historic problem for parties of both colours.The SNP's home affairs spokeswoman, Joanna Cherry, said the leaked plans showed ""the callousness at the core"" of the government, and the plans would ""treat vulnerable asylum seekers as cattle rather than human beings"".But Conservative MP for Gravesham in Kent, Adam Holloway, said the Home Office was ""completely right"" to be looking at other options that were ""some sort of deterrent"" for asylum seekers.He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""We need to break the link in people's minds that if you get to Britain you're going to stay in Britain, you're going to stay in a hotel and you're going to be accommodated.""He added that the UK needed to find a ""civilised version"" of the model used by Australia, which has controversially used offshore processing and detention centres for asylum seekers since the 1980s.The discussion comes as record numbers of people are crossing the Channel to the UK, with 400 arriving in one day in September.Ascension Island is more than 4,000 miles (6,000km) from the UKNearly 7,000 people have reached the UK in more than 500 small boats this year - by 23 September, 1,892 migrants had arrived during the month, more than in all of 2019.But they are still a small proportion of the asylum seekers coming to the UK. Eligible for asylumTo be eligible for asylum in the UK, applicants must prove they cannot return to their home country because they fear persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, gender identity or sexual orientation.A caseworker decides if they have a valid claim by taking into account factors such as the country of origin of the asylum seeker or evidence of discrimination.This is supposed to be done in six months but delays in processing claims have increased significantly in the last year.While waiting for a decision to be made, asylum seekers are usually not allowed to work and are initially placed in hostel-type accommodation before longer-term housing is arranged.","https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-54375347"
